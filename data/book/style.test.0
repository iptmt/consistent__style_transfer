i have to ask because i believe she had more pages dedicated to her overbearing , annoying ways than he did with his voice problem and romance .
sorry to write such a crappy review , but this book was not worth the money for me .
okay read for the beach or pool .
story is slow and plodding , characters are flat and bordering on unpleasant .
i wish i had saved my money and not bothered to buy this book .
what a mistake . what this book actually is , is a collection of the stupidest , most inane bit of " advice " ever put forth .
this kind of threat , the kind of humor , the kind of emphasis on sex , etc .
aside from a couple of brief asides , that did n't happen .
i try not to write reviews of books i don&#8217;t like .
i recieved this book for free and was not required to give a positive review or paid for my review .
but the constant boastful tone of the book does n't seem to jibe with that .
( please , do n't confuse me being upset with having no ending and having not a happy ending .
while pretty well written , this book is ridiculously long and not worth the time .
it was impossible to change the font size or the orientation of the page .
the language of the story and illustrations , were clearly geared to children , but the story was too confusing .
did the publisher just go straight to print with the author 's rough draft ? ? ?
i also found myself having to re - read sentences just to untangle them and make some sort of sense of them .
troublesome ? ! ?
i tried skipping over chapters that seemed repetitive .
just not that into this series anymore .
i was bored various times , and did n't enjoy the ending of the novel at all .
there are important flaws in the diet that should be pointed out .
i did not think this book was very good on a whole .
i could n't stand hearing this individual speak after more than a few pages .
could be his editors .
unfortunately , it is more about how the author wants to see dogs than about how dogs really are .
there 's the names .
i suppose a more spiritual person than i would get something out of it .
she said she did repeatedly but when he did n't do exactly what she wanted when she wanted she would run .
this unrealistic personality change is made more ludicrous in the spin - offs ( spin outs ) .
i have read everyone of the books and yes , it has gone down hill . but i think that the end was pathetic ! ! !
because she took off her glasses ? ? ?
it 's incredibly heavy on the exposition and setting , and i longed for a faster pace , and more places between chapters to take a break .
there is an implied contract between the author and the reader that the latter at least has a sporting chance to figure out who the killer is .
she thinks she hears edwards voice speaking to her and warning her not to do things when she is about to do something that might result in death .
i know that was the point of the book but it was annoying .
all the allusions make it sound really bad , but i did n't read enough to get specifics , if any were given .
as others have mentioned , this is just another string along book as it does n't advance the over - all story arc .
i do n't think i 'll be picking up anymore of the author 's books .
there has to be something out there positive to write about .
completely devoid of originality , long and boring passages about the anguish of love ... definitely not my cup of tea .
however , this book is too riddled with thinly disguised religious proselytizing to appeal to a secular person .
aside from that , there was nothing particularly objectionable in the story -- it would probably be rather fun to read for a teen audience .
going in to this book i had n't heard too much about it .
it was over .
there was nothing here . the plot was weak .
it seems that the author went through a checklist of cliches to make sure he would n't miss any .
other authors have written about forms of intelligence and learning that do n't seem to depend on the brain or intellect .
others have used the words " annoyingly arrogant and apparently editor - less man " and i totally agree .
many hardly give an impression of a garden at all , but instead focus on detail or architecture .
not a one was to be found .
but then the secret was revealed and i was relieved that i could keep reading .
this one just did n't do it for me !
this is just plain slop food .
there is zero " new " information or insight here .
i would have expected better from a reputable university .
i would really need that no star button for this book .... lousy is not even a strong enough term for it .
with it 's idealistic philosophies and overdrawn characters , it leaves much to be desired by the realist .
i have nothing to add here save a hear ye !
it was left out of this book for some reason .
the villain lacked menace , the hero lacked ingenuity , and given that there 's a countdown at the beginning of each chapter , there was very little sense of tension .
contrived and ridiculous is about all i can say !
i can not recommend this book , but apparently i am among the minority of the readers .
the book is called olive 's ocean , but it has nothing to do with olive .
i did n't finish the book
i hated it then .
occasionally someone gets it right , but more often i find the result lacking .
but i do n't want to sound too negative .
this book does nothing but plant smug superiority and encourage distrust and hatred .
he is so negative in his writing , in my opinion , coming from the standpoint of lack .
this is not intended as a compliment .
towards the end of the book i literally slogged through the tedium and then the mystery of the book is never answered .
skipping pages .
those nuggets of advice are misleading .
however , the aggressive male character seems to be very popular among female readers . this book has very little of a story to tell .
that said , on with the review . essentially , this book 's essays are to show the fallacy of fundamentalism .
there is no organized attempt , and no coherent summary , as to what is " wall street . "
i did not like the book however .
totally nauseating !
normally i 'm a fan of longer books , but the substance was not in this one .
i wanted to like this book much more than i did .
early in the book , my impression was the book had been written solely money for money .
i found the author 's narrative technique to be distracting , as she jumped from character to character and time period to time period in a rather haphazard manner .
an ok effort by a writer who needs a better editor .
i know it was a waste of money .
the characters go to magic school ... but what do they do there ? ?
i did nt expect a literary marvel since it was a free ebook .
but the writing felt very superficial to me bc there was absolutely nothing there that helped me understand how i might integrate any of this into my every day existence .
i could n't go on with the rest .
the bloom comes off the rose rather quickly , however .
there was no ending and it left me not knowing the conclusion .
example : i looked at her .
sorry i could not say that this book is worth the cost or time .
when will writers of memoirs learn that their boring self - absorbed selves are not worth writing about - but that the countries they visit and the people they meet are .
the idea that this woman would just forget all that for a business opportunity is ridiculous .
if you have a clue please let me know .
why did he continue to go back to visit her after they were already married ?
too bad - many deities should populate these pages .
some of character descriptions are ridiculous .
i almost considered putting the book down at that point , and not finishing .
this may not be in keeping with the character , but still it does not make for a satisfying read .
or that sleeping with him while taking his money might make her role a little unclear .
i found this novel to be rather boring .
it 's as if the author wrote a novel and her publisher told her to double the length so she went back and added all this unnecessary filler .
or like it was written by a pretentious high schooler with only a tenuous grasp on the era in which the story takes place .
this book was trying to show his use of descriptive words .
the analogy is fine , but it does n't need to be repeated ad nauseam .
it seemed to drag on .
he was childish , degenerate , and had few , if any , redeeming qualities .
but if you 're looking for an accurate critique of the nation , save your money .
the book so so very predictable .
is the idea of disagreement , debate or rebellion something that never happened in the past ?
it 's just bad .
i most certainly hope to never ever write in such a repetitive style .
i was very sad to have wasted money on this book .
this book is really pointless and awful .
the writing is worse than that -- it 's just bad .
totally a waste of time and energy .
hard to believe this guy has won major awards .
for me , though , it fell flat .
the sun rises , and i shall return the book to the library . stuff and nonsense .
go with a different publisher if you want a hardcopy .
actually the whole premise of the book is off .
the ending was downright insulting .
the writing , the dialogue and the storyline is pathetic .
that so many people do not wish to be confused with the facts is rather scary .
i believe this book was the most depressing one i 've ever read .
what i got however is philosophical jargon which confuses instead of clarifies .
do n't know now why i bothered .
i skipped pages from boredom .
that 's just bad writing . "
do n't waste your time or money - this one 's a stinker .
it just seemed like it had too many things repeating themselves .
the intensely partisan presentation of the story in this book is a gross offense to the characters of the inventors . in addition , the text is littered with errors .
it was way too depressing !
however , the characters were weak and the story jumped around .
unfortunately , i was completely let down at the end .
oh let me take something wacky and just jot it down and sell it - that is how this feels .
i did not like this story because is seemed more fantasy than i like to get into .
[ it 's not ] fine for those looking for a little sizzle , but not really worth purchasing or following the planned series .
it 's a self - indulgent , juvenile tirade against faith and authority that fizzles out into a wishy - washy " but then again , maybe not .
just too much dialog , though !
but what lacked for me was the main character 's story .
the characters did n't seem real to me either .
the worst flaw is that the characters are just not believable enough as humans with human feelings , even for a sword and sorcery fantasy .
this effort is just plain silly .
however , i am not going to waste money to find out .
i did not finish the book and am sorry i ever picked it up .
so much boring blah blah blah .
i guess if your teacher uses this method , you might learn piano but if you have a choice , look at other methods .
i have read this book and it was a difficult read .
an editor could have helped her dramatically here .
the characters were virtually unlikeable and one - dimensional .
her whole approach to her freeze - framing is so incredibly stupid .
the quality of this book as a resource for physics is impeccable . however , the print is often unreadable with letters merged and blurry .
by the end i was confused and actually bored .
i just did n't care , had a hard time finishing this one , despite the fact that it 's a fairly small book .
it might be the curse of anticipating a character 's book so much that it could never live up to those expectations .
she 's not particularly interesting .
the dialogue in particular is absurd .
the trouble is it would then be a short story .
do n't the idiots of the fantasy world see if they do n't he will just keep coming back to screw the land again ?
it got to be a chore rehashing what a bad job these guys did at times .
this is not a full review but a partial commentary .
yep . all sarcasm aside , the book was poorly edited , poorly written , and the character development and plot were amateur .
( read : these authors , who disagree with me , ca n't be sincere .
but , alas , it was not .
up until that moment , i guess this was an okay book .
she was introduced , forgotten , then found stranded in literally nowhere , and rescued by the heroes .
this book was just very hard to get into .
in fact , if he could have been the main character i think the book series would have been that much better .
thankfully , i wasted only a very brief part of my life with this horribly pretentious book .
edwards does a fantastic job of hooking the reader into this book , but the ending is sheer disappointment .
there is no nice way to say ' i hate this book .
if you are looking for a book on acrylic painting techniques , look elsewhere .
this book had me skipping around .
it is just not for me . i love all books fae .
but it 's also not not about angels .
but i believe this author has promise , and hope she 'll try again .
it is beyond stupid , boring and i could go on .
this book is comprised of the author 's musings on the subject of randomness .
this book was way too wordy for me .
) , the author did n't make up for by creating characters you could fall in love with - or even fall into friendship with .
i was creeped out by the premise and was very uncomfortable with the relationship between the trainers and the boys , the hero in particular .
and i do n't mean the quality , i mean it was appalling .
the only reason i actually finished this book was to see how the author would twist the plot to achieve the incredibly predictable outcome .
what a waste of money
a huge waste of time !
overwhelms the story and plot , characterization , and everything else just dissolve .
save your money and do n't waste your time on this one .
you know what 's annoying ?
if you read this review and buy this book anyway , don't say i did n't tell you .
it took a while though to figure out the main idea , since there was too much jumping around from race to race that figuring out the idea was a challenge .
the writing was uneven and repetitive , and failed to hold my attention .
i cannot believe they published this , because it 's dreck !
lastly , the story has just been dragging , making it too much work to keep trying . if you decide to read this book , be forewarned .
i have a shameful secret .
uptight guy falls for spitfire ?
the padding with pointless speculations and extraneous material is obvious throughout .
no corporate investigation ?
he comes off in this book as utterly clueless and fairly unlikeable .
these detours explain nothing , and do nothing to further the long awaited plot .
whatever the case , my recommendation would be to skip this book .
no , no , no , say it ai n't so !
but as an entire work this book is wholly unremarkable .
finally , i started skipping paragraphs and then pages .
i wish i could give it even worse ratings .
there 's a short description of accessories and camera settings , which was really too shallow to be useful .
( i wo n't even get into the larger - than - average fonts , wide margins and almost double - spaced sentences .
he manages to mention multiple times that he feels sorry for the poor guy .
i guess this is a way for him to relive his past and the frustration he feels about how fast it is disappearing .
the book seemed to never end .
i do n't mind an autobiography , just call it something else and provide the notion that it will be about that .
i am sad to say that this book let me down .
there seems to be endless talk , and that smacks of padding -- anything to fill the requisite number of pages .
they do not work .
whether the author is a man or a woman , those books clearly show narcissistic authors , with simplistic views who claim to lead the world to perfection .
so if you need advice , this is not the book for you .
unlike what he states , revolution is moved by the low strata of the society . i like balance representation of facts , and i do not care for biased journalism .
i found this book difficult to read , bordering on painful actually .
and i am completely disappointed . forget about foundation for a min ...
there is no chemistry that i detected between them , other than sexual energy .
this book is dated .
otherwise its an ok read .
predictable and a boring read .
' patient zero ' just is n't that .
unfortunately , the writing is pretty bad and the story just drags on without seeming to go anywhere .
no romance to get the girl back after he decided he needed to be free before he could be with her , after he went after her .
so unless i am missing a short story ?
from the book cover flap : " ... reach your fullest potential as a human being " " what would we look like if we became like him ?
i guess it just was n't for me .
it jumped around a lot and i had a really hard time connecting with the book .
the author clearly tries to be humourous ... but , in my opinion does not succeed in doing so .
if you really have to read it , then try the library .
it 's not like the author is subtle , after all . the fact is , the author simply does n't know how to develop and reveal characters and/or motives .
i would not have read this book if it had not been a selection for the book discussion group to which i belong .
the subject of this book was of great interest to me , and yet it was boring .
this is a decent publisher , so i 'm shocked there was n't some more thorough editing .
i forced myself to finish when i realized there was another book coming out .
do n't buy it ... save your money ... btw , the best part about this book was the cover .
there were so many misspellings , typos , and other mistakes in this book that i could n't get past them to actually enjoy the read .
however the writing is uneven , excessively wordy , repetitive , the dialogue fragmented , and the story drags in places .
this is a man trying to create female characters and it just does n't work .
as a white woman i find the title offensive because it implies that these are the typical white girls ' problems and they are not .
the book was rushed and not believable to me .
i keep hoping her books will go back to normal , but it 's been very hit or miss lately .
i would put examples here of some of the scenes that ensue but it is too repulsive to publish .
no explanation is given , just supernatural creatures from no known place , doing things for no particular reason .
if there 's a seal , i expect to see some serious action . instead , i got a lot of people running back and forth and very little action .
the characters , while mostly skin - deep , had potential .
i did not care what happened to these annoyingly vapid characters ... i would skip this one , readers .
found it boring , stupid and just felt like a waste of time .
but there are authors who manage to write emotionally and thematically complex novels with detailed plots , but with a style that does n't call attention to itself .
too many names listed and all of their connections , which took away from the storyline .
then back , then forth and back again .
if only the content was equally interesting .
therefore any money she has been paid for this book is blood money .
now , i 'm not religious but this author appears to be as the this book is riddled with religion .
i felt i was reading the same book over again .
the description on the book 's back cover would have you believe this is a rollicking farce about a lovable cad --- don't you believe it .
( but this is n't a huge complaint of mine .
i loved what to expect before you 're expecting and what to expect when you 're expecting , and i am very disappointed in this book .
i read through the " sex " bits and i felt awkward .
i thought this book would be a biography , but it starts out immediately on a racist rant .
i thought it was nothing but garbage .
and by kind of , i mean it 's really annoying .
how do they feel about not having any rights ?
plot details rehash over and over , and story is going nowhere ... trying very hard to finish
a long drawn out , overly detailed and a poor representation of a past presidency through the eyes of his wife .
this negates what someone says without having to address content .
if this scene was meant to heighten suspense it did not .
i know there are some readers who may think i am a dummy because i did n't like it , but believe me i 'm not .
i wasted my money but fortunately it was very cheap .
" i 'm convinced the story is completely fictional , which in itself is no sin , but by masquerading as truth , it never achieves the quality of either .
( it 's been hard to find in print . )
stirling never fleshes out his characters , not even the leads , and forget about the more minor figures - they 're just cardboard stereotypes .
instead i found the book to be poorly written , dull and vapid .
i tried the next book of hers in the series , but sadly could n't get into it , and gave up ( something i rarely do ) .
i do n't know what i expected this book to be , but i do know i was disappointed in reading it .
it 's a repetitive bore .
and i hate that this has topped it off .
too weird for me
even getting past the disgusting opening , it 's boring .
there is potential here for a decent story , if time had been put into working out actual plot and character development .
as it stands , it 's nearly an insult the intelligence of any remotely intelligent reader .
the author sucks you in with a forgotten birthday , a voodoo doll , but does n't finish these story lines ...
i will not recommend it .
his style of shifting time periods and narrators , which worked so well in his other novel , just did n't seem to work for this one .
the girl she used to be was a very hard book to concentrate on because it jumped around a lot and was not very realistic .
basically he says a lot about nothing .
but this scene made me wonder - why does anyone wear clothes at all ?
i do not remember this book being advertised for young adults .
not really interested in reading the remainder of this series , but i will continue to support this author .
even the plotting makes sense , but my enjoyment of the book was completely spoiled by what i can only describe as very poor writing .
i might just be a teen in high school but i know what i like and this book was not one in my interest .
the beginning was very jumpy and i really had no idea where they were located or who all the characters were - people were frequently dead after a couple of pages .
does n't he trust his readers to form our own opinions ?
just a plain weird book .
nothing new , just elementary , recycled stuff .
unfortunately , i was disappointed in the title .
the action is just insanely unbelievable , it is constant near death and then escaping by the thinnest margins and by some really convenient means .
they are listed by page number and appear to be in order of the quotation within each page .
by the way could somebody tell me what ever happened to the fig ?
the rest of the book is self serving , all knowing , ever wise doctor blather .
in fact , it gets many things very , very wrong .
do n't spend your money !
does n't anyone fact check anymore ?
this was a book that i struggled to finish , but will still give the next book a try .
every other sentence seems to start with " i had a client who " .. tiresome writing and nothing new , even if you can get through the terrible editing .
he is quite a decent painter and therefore is allowed to paint fish for the doctor instead of doing tough manual labour .
it was not well written and i was disappointed in this book .
but as a romance novel , this book left me cold .
now , unless for some reason there was a problem with the download and not the book there was no ending .
the most obvious matter is this : if atheism is vanishing , then this should be shown through basic data and evidence .
when i say poorly written i mean that in the sense that the story lacks luster , but also the grammar is flat - out bad .
the book got better as it went along but i was so dissapointed in this one .
i also did n't like it that he was a thief - and an average one at best .
the book does not adequately explain .
too insubstantial .
i am always extremely disappointed as i get into the book to find foul , vulgar , and irreverent language that completely ruins what could be a decent and entertaining story .
the worst error was a chart with a mis - labeling of a rune .
the book is repetitive and in other ways not well written .
i 'm glad i get it from the library , you should too .
the supposedly " dark " demon characters are so goody - goody it 's liking watching puppies try to be guard dogs .
the sentences jumble , the word choices stop the eye , and the flow is just missing .
is the fact that a major sex scene occurs that is completely non - consensual .
that part of the story was just kind of dropped off and barely a part of the end .
i wonder how much of it is just " urban legend " repeated .
this is a big ' oops ' for me - i do n't know when i 've read a book with such little interaction between a hero & heroine .
bought it out of curiosity , hoping to guess who the real " author " was .
no where , in any of it , was the word " meditation .
however , each chapter barely scratches the surface of the subject matter .
i know it 's how kids talk sometimes but it was annoying .
the whole big plot explanation was a serious disappointment . then there is the actual ending .
however the reality of reading ( or attempting to read ) this book was tedious and awkward .
the story line was flat , it never really evolved .
the dialogue was bland , the characters ridiculous , the editing sloppy .
it wasn't . why appalling ?
he 's actually not " one of you , " or so he says .
on top of that , the writing was weak , almost as if this was an early work reprinted .
not an enjoyable read .
guess i will keep looking .
i 'm having a hard time figuring out why .
it just was n't for me and did n't keep my interest .
do n't waste your time of money .
the only reason i finished this book is because i paid money for it .
is that the point ?
in this novel the characters seem not only very specific , but very small ; they are neither familiar nor important .
your last several books have gotten worse but you should be ashamed of this cash grab .
absolutely not !
if she does n't think so , she should n't have addressed these lies in a book addressed to women in particular .
i returned the book and told my friend that i did n't believe it .
i mean , there were some redeeming qualities , but overall just a terrible read .
but this book just does n't cut it .
this one had a very simplistic plot by comparison .
i 'm also not a fan of contrived plots .
it is inappropriate for non - alcoholics .
the repetition is maddening .
i was determined to finish it so just skimmed through thinking it would get better but never did .
i really wanted to like this one ... but i was so disappointed !
so not only is she stupid for leaving college for some guy she has only know for a short period of time .
just when the plot is beginning to ( pardon , ca nt ' help it ) sink into predictable soap opera territory , wham !
it is dark , and depressing .
it 's hard to enjoy a book where the main character is so annoying .
the ending left me totally disappointed .
as it was , i got sick of reading about the overly naive heroine and the brooding protaganist .
no , really .
i really wanted to love this book but could not .
that being said , the book promises a lot that it does n't actually deliver on .
it was a rather good book , i thought ; but the author was disappointed in receiving nothing but rejection slips from a number of publishers .
sex , profanity , sex .
the premise sounded so interesting , but the book is awful .
i finally just gave up and stopped reading it .
it seemed like they written in just so the author had something else to write about other than a real plot .
i hate buying a book and " wasting " it , but could not tolerate the writing style .
that smells dirty . the author does not provide a index with any documentation of many of the cases or incidents he claims happened .
and instead got " short changed . "
it 's a good metaphor for this piece : it tries too hard and the resulting prose is n't pretty .
his responses to her , his reactions and even some of his words are incredibly cryptic . so this book was just frustrating .
but ultimately , that was the entire book .
i mean it started getting ridiculous and kids seemed to be dying just for the sake of dying .
some also require a lot of prep work and cooking before putting in slow cooker which i personally do n't like .
the lack of detail is the problem .
sadly , i would probably agree .
i 'm willing to suspend disbelief , but this was pushing it .
do i really want to sell it at market ?
i do n't care what everyone eats for every meal .
the only other options appear to be an effective missile shield which she casually dismisses as a waste , or perhaps surrender .
if i 'd known that i never would have downloaded it ...
it was n't quite " it was all a dream " or " the narrator 's in a psych ward . "
i would n't recommend giving this to your child , or they might fear growing up .
her poorest work , boring , with an credibly weak ending .
it 's redundant and long - winded .
basically the h chases the h to the point of getting him to marry her for her fortune .
but this installment was n't up to par with her earlier novels .
the characters were frustrating at best , and while the basic premise wasn&#8217;t exactly original , i had hoped for something less formulaic .
they are melodramatic caricatures of the real thing .
that makes this a really difficult novel to slog through .
it was almost boring .
the idea of a human and a vampire having sex is disturbing enough .
it was awful from the beginning !
did we read the same book ?
so there is nothing i hate more than a cheap bodice - ripper romance disguised as a ghost story .
overall , too much description about flipping houses .
i was excited to read this , because i thought the description looked so good , but it was n't anything great .
it seem to be written ok .
warning to those who dislike graphic sex scenes , this book is not for you .
i wo n't spoil it for you , but it was one of those unrealistic " too perfect " endings that ties up all the loose ends without really explaining anything .
there were too many settings that were a little too convenient .
i actually hoped there would be an opportunity to look " inside " the book before purchase .
i 'm sorry , i wish i could give a more positive review .
wish i had the time wasted on this book reading something else .
this is not so much a book as a screed against the liberalism in society that the author believes is the root of all evil .
i must agree , however , with many of the other reviewers of this book that it 's not on a par with earlier books in the series .
is this another device ?
and frankly i 'd love to have back all the time i wasted on this story .
it was almost as if the author attempted to stretch his creative energy without actually reading what he had written .
" review : i had high standards for this book .
sorry , i know its disappointing , but just like all his other recent books , the word ' average ' encapsulates perfectly .
i thought that character development was poor .
worth the $ .99 i paid , but not more .
there was too much unimportant detail .
i felt like i got much , much , more from his course than i would from this book , which i 'll probably return .
i guess because i always do finish .
rarely do i find that i can not finish a book , especially one that is pretty short , but this one seemed way longer than it needed to be .
no great character quirks , nothing to make me say " hmmm , did n't see that coming ! "
the villain was really terrible - what was his motivation ?
i had hoped to love this book , but it is n't happening .
if , at any point , a woman says no or stop , but the man does n't , then it 's rape .
never read this author before and more than likely never will again .
that was what was so confusing . i will say that one was not able to foresee the final ending .
i should n't have bothered .
books from screenplays are usually not very good , but this was just plain bad .
i prefer to have information presented and come up with my own opinions .
there were also some parts that made little to no sense .
i enjoy reading books about behavioral psychology , yet i found this particular book lacking in any real new information that has not been previously addressed in other books .
not too many books could follow that act .
i was excited to read this book , i love both archaeology and mysteries , however , i was disappointed with the read .
i have re - read all of her earlier books but this book i could not finish .
i went to the site and see that there is a fee , though , to be fair , it could be minimal .
author seems to have lost his gift for writing .
i felt like i had read it before , either i have or it was just that unsurprising .
it 's as if he is trying too hard to be authentic , and ironically , he ends up coming off as contrived .
the author of this book is so self absorbed it was very irritating .
perhaps less .
overall this book does not present anything new , its all stuff i 've heard before .
it would seem obvious that if moral values are the products of individual evaluation , that speaking of collective values employs an ambiguous collective fallacy .
very overrated book .
but there was nothing funny about it .
it is very poorly made .
worse still , quoting classics far too often to the point of cliche .
but i begin to wonder if this culture of ' taking the law ' does n't promote this type of behavior .
i 'm frankly puzzled by the previous glowing reviews of this book .
too much sodium is very unhealthy .
i did n't bother to buy this one .
she has compelling moments , but most of this book is filled with cliches , combined with strange word choices and dubious grammatical command .
sorry , if i 'm blunt but it 's how i feel .
i wanted to read this because it sounded interesting from the previous reviews .
are we all supposed to imagine she killed herself or murdered him ? ? ? ?
she mostly felt sorry for herself and talked about her truly awful boyfriend .
his metaphor is strained and does not work .
the predictions of the book are dire .
after a short time , this becomes tiresome and boring .
and on and on , such mistakes are too numerous to mention here and have an irritating cumulative effect .
i would say do n't bother on this one .
this book basically implied that giving your baby any formula is just short of child abuse and breastfeeding is the only option , no matter what .
the story reads as though little effort went into creating it .
most people are not in a stable or coherent mentality when the thought of suicide occurs .
i was bored , bored , bored .
i really wanted to like this book but just could n't .
this book is a sorry excuse for science or criticism based on science .
terrible writing , contradictory / unlikely scenarios and situations .
the solution to the mystery is ridiculous and unsatisfying .
the " house " itself does n't appear until you 're too tired to care and the jumping from one disjointed scene to the next is just exhausting .
it is not so much that there are no productive uses for capital , it is just that the speculative uses are much more appealing than the productive uses .
the plot , from my initial skimming , was illogical and the characters poorly developed .
there was nothing factual other than lists of music .
but apparently buying a horse was not just an impulse to soothe her inner child 's desire , but actually the result of a chemical imbalance in her brain .
to correct grammar / typos / continuity ?
honestly , in my opinion there is nothing to tell here .
i felt let down by the end of the book .
this book is a waste of your time , any redeeming qualities can be far out weighed by other much better books !
no fewer than three psychic characters were required to make the story work , and i 'm using the term " work " rather loosely .
the new characters do n't really add much to the story nor is there an emotional attachment to either of them .
worse , he regularly works with cancer patients charging them for his convoluted and contradictory techniques .
i 'm sure that this book started off with good intentions , but it absolutely did not accomplish anything positive for teen suicide or bullying awareness .
it 's really a shame because i had such high hopes for this book .
the mechanics of the world are boring .
it was correctly pointed out that many obscure works are of very high quality and unless i 'd read both , i could hardly have an informed opinion on the matter .
this story was absolutely stupid .
i believe the information was for anyone who wanted to use it , but it was not for diabetics specifically .
it appeals to the worst in all of us .
and again - there is nothing new here .
maybe i am not the target audience , but i found most of this book to be whiny and not very funny or enlightening .
deeply odd is similar in it 's disappointments .
it has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high - risk pregnancy .
if you were raped , you 're not a virgin .
overall i give it a half a star and a big thumbs down .
the writing style was poor and the story was just plain boring .
worse is the quizzes and exams that this book 's publishers give professors to use .
i made the recommended adjustments and was disappointed .
aside from their occupations , they were uninteresting .
a decent editor might have been able to get more of a flow or consistency if voice out of this author .
she messed up all the other chracters ... they did n't even sound like themselves .
i am not a qualified paleontologist , so i asked one .
normally i will power through a book i purchase even if i do n't particularly enjoy it but i finally just moved on to something else with this on .
the reason i think is that the beginning of the novel is so scattered .
i was tempted to give up on it but thought to myself , " how long can it take to finish ? "
and not at all well - written , either ... this guy 's a professional ?
nothing -- whether " doing " or " receiving . "
it 's extremely predictible .
the main point of my review is that this is not a bad book with bad advice but it is more of a feel good book with common sense advice .
that 's right - it has no notes of any kind , despite the author 's nearly continuous quoting or referring to other writers and thinkers on nearly every page .
this was another do n't like it book .
this is a book that should never have been written nor ever published .
there were too many characters with their own issues thrown together in the life or death experience .
the main characters of the story are poorly developed and the plot has more loopholes than twists and turns .
not only would this not happen , it 's cheating on the part of the author who does n't have the skill to finish the story in a more credible fashion .
as a female reader , through all of his other books , i never felt as if the story was written to appeal to a specific gender .
the sex scenes are boring , predictable and repetitious .
it offered neither .
too harsh ?
i gave the book back to the library , happy i did n't pay for it .
because i paid good money for this dreck .
insubstantial , boring , should have been edited by someone else .
surely there was a more clever way to do this than boring the reader .
it is a valiant attempt but less would have been more ; there are too many story lines and no real conclusion .
i kept expecting a different sort of resolution to that aspect of the narrative .
a god book but for all the foul mouths .
character development poor .
she all of a sudden had faith and blah blah blah .
would get a refund if possible .
however , most of the other characters are a little wooden .
it might be for you but it 's definitely not for me .
this book is weak , and one wonders whether there is anything inherently inferior in modern serialized novels .
it was very painful reading this one ... really bad !
the hero is extremely weak , but on a forced " ca n't be perfect " way .
this book was so stupid i could n't finish it .
the actual plot only takes up a couple pages and is so underdeveloped , it is laughable .
this book is supposed to be a funny , casual conversation about gender differences and dating and relationships .
that 's probably where this novel would have ended had it been submitted under another author - name .
only the author 's translations are to be found without alternative versions or any critique of his work or interpretations by academics .
all the women are simpering idiots or manipulative .
i thought this book was such a waste of my time .
but it is hard to make those precepts last a whole book .
there was no real conflict .
this book is so dull .
drop it in the trash .
or something to that effect .
etc ) .
over - all i decided the story was a good one but i think it would be better not listened to , but read .
apparently in this make believe world the authors write from " disposable " markers do n't spend eternity in a land - fill and really are disposable ...
how anyone can be brainwashed to believe she 's someone else 's girlfriend and worse , the boyfriend accepts her is asking too much of the reader .
this happens often . as for the content , the books seems to have more lengthy , and meaningless , conversation than his other books .
and spends so much time talking about what you ca n't do ( in my opinion obviously ) .
i learnt nothing new about her .
i think the title says a lot calling violent children as savage spawn .
this book was a major disappointment .. and very difficult to stay focused on .
i picked up this book hoping to find out something new about the world of prostitution .
i was not at all invested in the story .
i am all for giving the reader information , but the book and the writing style were very choppy and detached .
i could n't get through it - i tried but just not that interesting - just stopped reading it ...
his relentless explication of the many facets of his moral code are by far the worst parts of the novel .
in fact he kind of weirded me out .
kept feeling like something was going to happen .. but then .. no .
as i was reading , i kept waiting for some development and i was continually disappointed .
perhaps if i had kept plodding though it , i would understand all the praise , but i had better things to do .
i do n't recall any profanity .
i agree with several reviewers who said that this diet is nothing but a fad .
the main character starts as somewhat of a feminist and ends up marrying the " rich , handsome " blah blah blah - it 's an insult to strong women everywhere .
i regret that this one was a disappointment and even mildly irritating at times .
it started out alright .
this book confirms that he lives in another galaxy that only exists in delusional and disturbed minds . i could not even finish this thing .
but this only equals to average writer literature , and does n't deserve most of the obsessive praise that it receives .
i very rarely put a book down unfinished but i have wasted too much time already .
i did n't hate it but i am not sure it was worth reading .
it makes her seem much weaker , which is a shame . a personal pet peeve of mine is the ` cold and calculating ' aspect of software development .
the irritating heroine kept talking , on and on and on .
and even though they 're ridiculous , they 're still quite predictable . any reader worth her salt will figure out some of the major points of the book .
it really disappointed me .
when she does , she spends much time on the sexist attitude of the doctors .
this was nt a book it was a short short story .
that , to me , is the proof - but not that the ' animal version ' is correct .
either the competition was very weak , or the publisher did a marvelous job marketing , otherwise all the awards this book got are a mystery to me .
it 's nothing but a collection of flat short stories , each predictable and hurried .
the exercise program provided ( a significant portion of the book ) is not very suitable for me .
i 'm going to donate it to the library in hopes others will check it out before purchasing it .
i stuck it out , but it really was n't worth it .
nothing else in the entire book lives up to that moment .
boring .. beginning had potential , but author played it safe .
( see discussion of this point below .
in some cases the idea was good but the execution was poor , or the writing was good but the story itself was poor , or both .
the plot was very thin and predictable .
i need a glossary -- maybe there is one in the print edition .
nothing memorable .
it was truly awful .
the drawings and text in this book are really outdated .
i did not care about them , and i doubt you will either .
it was filled with " filler " - just words that took up space and had no content .
if you do n't like foul language in your reading , skip this book .
i tried and tried , but this book never interested me .
the book was boring and i ca n't imagine that the movie is any better .
not recommended at all . carol [ ... ]
as it is their angle of the story is not developed at all .
i can only imagine if someone had a miscarriage that it would be similar but not the same .
it 's like the author wanted her to be stupid bimbo .
even though she has some beautiful descriptions in the book of scenes in the circus , sadly this did not make up for the slap dash feel of the story .
a little too far fetched for me .
i was very disappointed . the writing in this book is very bland .
if they sense they are being pushed , their guard goes up -- and even if they do comply , lingering resentment undermines the relationship ... maybe forever .
the book just goes downhill from there .
that person intended the casual comment in no derogatory sense , but only as an honest evaluation -- and one with which i can not disagree .
it 's so bad i ca n't overstate that .
even the children , whose characters i could not warm up to and found extremely annoying , are given the same voice as the adults .
halfway through this false ending i had completely lost interest .
characters simply drop out of the narrative .
but , this author seems to have enough writing talent that she may get better with time .
where is any original thought ?
i was expecting and hoping for more .
it 's too bad that it was n't for me .
does n't he ever get to enjoy some time with his rescued conquest ? )
i could n't even get into the story as the writing style put me off that badly .
it was heavily cliched in both its writing style and plot and i was bored -- which is the kiss of death .
yawn . this book was in need of a good pruning by a skilled editor , but apparently all the good editors were elsewhere .
the build up was impossibly slow and the end was a total bust .
i do not need a fairy tale finish but geez leave your readers with some sense of satisfaction for purchasing and reading all of your books .
i have turned , instead , to collections of actual speeches and letters from the time .
then i realized that her outrageously abusive childhood had obviously warped her perception of herself ( and other overweight people ) .
nearly in the same sweep of keys she labels many of the same as pseudo - scientists .
it seems to me that it is impossible to use science to disprove / prove the existence of god .
tedious , confused and so not - what - i - had - expected - it - to - be .
however , the writing was absolutely pretty bad .
it just difficult for me to appreciate and hard , slow reading .
maybe it helped her to get stuff off her chest .
in fact , i was bored while reading the book .
this would have been a problem if they succeeded .
the same was true for the female lead .
* * edited - i did n't make it through the book .
mostly , i wanted to see what the heck the book was all about - most of it seemed confusing and disjointed .
i started to roll my eyes at the melodramatic feel .
not in the conscious sense -- which you mean .
this book started off nicely but then quickly went downhill .
unfortunately , i 've already found a couple of the codes actually have " typos " in them .
note to the publisher : fire this editor because they have lost their ability to recognize good fiction .
the book needed to be edited before it was published , got sick of the word ( had ) i kept falling to sleep while reading .
the man would fall asleep , and the woman would hope her partner was dead , because she was going to kill him otherwise .
i did n't enjoy his style .
i do n't know what i was expecting .
but i think when it got to the " drowning " scene , i lost it completely .
it went from being a good story with interesting characters to ending with this silly , obvious attempt to go out with a bang . thud !
it was not a memoir like it leads you to believe .
with that said , there would not be much left .
i ca n't even visualize some of the places the author mention and there is so much waste of time on that .
other than that i did n't find any new details .
much more research should go into writing a story for publication .
this , however , is not .
it was n't graphic at least .
perhaps there are paragraphs missing
it would be boring .
or : " lies sell ! "
some of the ideas are plain stupid at best .
this latter exercise contributes nothing to the book , by the way !
i also like stories w / real history but i felt the story was overwhelmed by the history and just plain rambling of this person and this or such .
that 's what you pay your editors for ?
" rejected by mainstream society after the war because she says " i stank like a dog .
not in - depth regarding the details claimed in the sales blurb .
he just wanted the money , and this novel screams it .
the plot turned out okay on the end but still added some nonsense at the end .
i did n't find the book particularly intense or deep .
save your money until the crowning of a new king .
why do that ?
i could feel sorry for her , but i could n't like her . i really hated the use of sex in this book .
here are the reasons why i did n't like this book.1 .
the alpha manliness just is n't there for me , not like her other books .
if you do n't , or only like quality westerns , give this one a pass .
sure this is reality , but that off itself is not a reason to be boring .
yes , very rarely , something odd happens .
i heard good things about this book , but i just could not finish it .
the point was lost on me .
if you have any sense of the literary mind , save yours .
instead , it felt like such a let down .
" rancid melodrama .
there was a dark side to this lesson , however .
prefer dialogue .
the worst part is , he seems like an outsider looking in .
i do n't care why he behave this way but he should show more self respect and more respect of his business ! !
rather like a really bad twilight zone serial ; a lump of melted down human with a keyboard sticking out of it .
however the story did not hold my attention at all .
can you say stupid ... dumb ... waste of paper ?
do n't waste your money on this book , i sure wish i had n't .
the book was depressing , all about herself and did n't really care about anything else .
i expected something more complex and interesting at least .
let me get right to the point .
i know the age difference will bother some , but it was not a problem for me .
wish i had not spent the money on it .
what i read : this was not supposed to happen to any child we adopted .
inconsistent .
the book is not poorly written in any way but it did never really catch my interest when reading it .
it is racist .
however , this cat story was not what i was expecting .
why pay more for an e - book which costs less to produce than for a hard copy ?
it needs to be cut .
the writing is slow and jumps to much .
it 's did n't hold my attention .
but not so ; strictly external .
not that it really should matter so much . girls -- those of you who think you 're getting an accurate window into a guy 's mind .. you 're not .
perhaps i expected the writing to be more poetic since the author is a published poet but in this too i was disappointed .
hence the low star rating .
check , check . )
her books bore me sorry just my opinion !
it could have been good had she worked longer than an hour on it but , as is , do n't waste your money .
in terms of diet advice , this book is worthless .
i skimmed though the final few chapters , bored to tears .
this book was so slow , so boring , so uninteresting in every respect , that i simply could not continue .
she should be ashamed .
even with all the talk and interest in horse racing going on around me - i just could n't get interested in this book .
the book has a long boring list that is even boring to follow in your kindle .
that irritated me to no end .
it 's not bad , just really weird .
the author is at pains to describe at length some of these magical images , but provides no picture .
she did n't interest me in the least and she was way too insecure .
this was the most boring true crime book i ever read , and unfortunately , it was also the longest .
but i found this book obnoxious enough that i returned it . you , however , may like it a lot .
it 's simply not up to his usual standard of work .
until i came across completely erroneous statements prevented as facts .
i was attracted to this book by the title .
this book is mainly dialog from evie both internal and her dialog with others .
and honestly ?
it generates the kind of morbid fascination one feels when looking at a particularly repulsive animal .
not what i 'd like to have seen .
and then the fact that the characters were not likeable at all , dull , and missing that spark of life .
i felt the story had potential , but i could n't get past the issues i mentioned above .
even after growing up in a household skeptical of ghost hunting endeavors , the plot did sound promising .
long conversations with the same dull characters over and over .
there was too much about passing it around and people being followed but not enough substance .
reads poorly , certainly not like a historical narrative .
it 's really horrible .
i am not really sure about this last installment .
so i just got tired of it .
dangerous stuff ...
there was actually no special reason to get the baby out .
this was the most disappointing instalment yet .
the author 's constant reference to her past accomplishments were both self serving and unnecessary .
) , there was nothing in it that anyone who 's read the newspaper would n't know .
this book is certainly not a useful guide as such .
sue is weak , whiny , and ca n't do anything for herself .
the woman in this story was just to weak for my liking .
this cd is very brief and not worth the money .
the author is trying too hard to be unique , he loses his readers and the chance to explore his original premise in a meaningful way .
i expected so much more -- i felt almost cheated .
i wasted my time skipping over meaningless drivel only to come to the end of the book and gained no satisfaction what - so - ever .
it 's not just that this catalog of crimes , blunders , and wasted lives and treasure makes depressing reading , although it does .
there could be a great book on this subject , but this is not it .
in other words , they do n't rule god out of existence . mr .
lousy writer - will not read her stuff again - style of writing boring - would not ask anyone to read it - do you give refunds or not ?
best selling author .... really ? ? ? ?
it was hugely disappointing .
really thin story and characters that never fully got my attention .
save you money .
believe me , it was a struggle to finish this thing .
the story might have been more palatable if i had read the actual book .
there almost needs to misspellings and an un - thought out layout .
i am donating it to the local library as i could not get anywhere near finishing it .
the chapter topics are not nearly as interesting as the first book 's .
waste of money , and not worth the time to find out how dreadful it was .
i was wrong . i found it difficult to read because of mistakes with capitalization .
but it does n't try to .
i tried and tried but could nt not finish this book .
it is a cruel , misguided and ill informed author to purport such a message .
the historical thread is confused and confusing and in the end the story becomes dull .
( better yet , do not waste your time reading it . )
it 's hard for me not to like a book on a topic i 'm just fascinated about , but this one , just did n't do it for me .
she seemed like she could take or leave her husband , which was very unbelievable .
furthermore , it is not real !
metaphor ?
i did finish the book but , honestly , it seemed pointless .
apparently it 's a work of non - fiction , but i do n't view that as an excuse .
set off my warning bells . obviously i did n't enjoy it .
if you must read this book , do nt ' waste your money buying it .
it was a bunch of stories about / from various hikers .
really disappointed !
i than read in the aftermath that the book was developed from a short story the author had written ( perhaps after it was chosen for development ? ) .
that way , no one 's tastes are offended .
another bloated text , this time made worse by the juvenile verbiage .
this plot is muddied by numerous subplots , intrigue and romances , including a gay one that takes precedence .
it had tremendous potential but it never went any where and when it ended there was no resolution to any of the plot threads .
i stand by that name for the act because she did not want it .
had i not made it more engaging by sharing it with my child , i would have found it impossibly boring and insulting to my intelligence .
were murderers because they were so typical and so annoying .
thin plot , dull , no entertainment value and poor character development .
and that is not another way of me saying it had a cliffhanger ( which it did ) , but i mean just what i said .
this causes a disruption in the flow of the story and increases the drag .
oh , and it 's bland .
i totally lost interest shortly after the bomb was delivered .
as i said in another review , get over it . don't think i 'll bother with another cf book .
or , at least it had the potential to be .
the story itself was good but the book could have been soooo much better .
do n't spend money on this book .
i understand that the repeating of the lives was the point , but it just was n't done in a way that i found interesting after a while
i really need to learn not to judge a book by its cover .
the plot is contrived and obvious .
i labored till the end because i hate giving up .
the characters jump back and forth between views with no credibility whatsoever .
i 'm sorry to say this one did - big trouble .
i think this book has a point that another book does n't have .
such obvious attempts to sound hip and youthful are painfully common throughout the book , and they are not restricted to the dialogue alone .
not there .
i checked the description , but maybe not the buyers ' comments well enough -- i was surprised to find only guitar tabs .
not only did i hate how this book is written , i could not follow what it was written about .
could n't finish it which is very rare for me .
she has no idea what she 's talking about , or she is misrepresenting - or maybe both .
it never really explained the " rise and fall " of heavy metal , it just had many mini - bios of the genre 's biggest names .
i am an avid reader but never wrote a review before .
but honestly , if you are in tuned enough to your child 's life to be reading parenting books , you do n't need this book .
the book is almost entirely devoted to describing instances of snap judgements that either assisted or led people astray in their decision making .
it was n't a terrible book , it had some interesting things to say , but we could not understand all the immensely positive reviews here .
if i was judging this book solely on the merits of the art , it would earn an " a " for sure .
this was an incredibly frustrating book .
-- but this book reads like a rough draft which needed substantial editing to tighten it up .
i personally would not recommend it .
gwen claims that because of her " gypsy gift " she can never forget anything .
though the questions asked were interesting , the answers were n't and all felt a bit ridiculous .
the dialog is pathetic ....
not a great book in the mystery - crime genre .
it 's the same thing over and over again .
the plot was weak and too much time was spent re telling the same story of all the characters .
i found some errors in scholarship here .
instead the reader is left with a lot of dangling story lines .
silly comes to mind .
this was incredibly boring .
maybe lost his edge after his earlier works .
the usage and grammar are awkward ( a character " sort of vaguely " makes a gesture ) ; the punctuation is annoyingly haphazard .
it feels so unfinished .
the search for a middle ground is headed up by men who are struggling deeply with scripture that contradicts their personal beliefs .
but the symptom does n't translate directly to the abuse .
the plot skips around too much , and has too many poorly developed characters throughout the book .
fun , but weak .
as it was , i did do a bit of skimming in the middle because freaking hell nothing was happening .
in her pocket ?
it was a good story but not my type of reading .
this plus is not enough to redeem this series from its failings , however .
people are introduced with name and description who never appear again .
so the end may have been brilliant - i just could n't get there .
the characters are very superficial and undeveloped .
would n't they just kill her immediately ?
she and the general reading public would be best served if she stuck to generic silly inauthentic regency romances in the future .
.it did n't .
while the plot itself had promise , it was not interesting enough to consume the entire book .
i 'm not making that .
she finally gets it , but she is still stupid .
content is ok but not the book i thought i would receive .
paragraphs are badly formatted .
sorry , she ai n't my taste
i could n't take the same crappy story all over again with the kids , so i did n't even bother continuing any further .
however , this book portrays the clergy in a very negative light and not just a little bit .
at the time i was uneducated and foolish like many people .
was n't as good as i expected considering all the hype around the author .
let 's make this thing over the top .
it comes across as a very long " setting the stage " for a novel , but , to use a trite expression , " where 's the beef ? "
the sample was dry and not interesting . i read a lot of books like this about curious facts .
i mean , the entire book was confusing , and very boring , but the ending in particular was confusing .
it was scattered and unfocused and a major disappointment .
it 's not fundamentalist .
there are better authors around .
i found nothing fresh or funny about this book .
have n't gotten very far and not sure if i will bother to finish it .
it just is n't enjoyable reading at that point .
the synopsis had me rolling on the floor .
the reason i could not enjoy this book is because of the endless amount of stories in it .
but it was like he just completely changed into someone else .
what an awful mess this book is .
i got so bored throughout the book and distracted with other things because it just was n't a captivating read .
i would not recommend it if i were paid to read it , and paid a lot !
i felt that the writing fell flat and the characters were not well developed .
not only was this story implausible and undocumented , it absolutely gushed with admiration and enthusiasm for the subject .
stupid plot , dull characters , thinly disguised caricatures of real people .
the plot is predictable , and shallow .
the latter statement negates the rule .
i do n't hate the book ... rather , it left me unmoved .
unfortunately , the wonder is never realized .
sorry , but this book was n't a good fit for me .
there was another death that seemed to be connected to the other murders , but ended up having an odd , almost tacked - on resolution .
the ending was a little too weird for my taste .
however , the more recipes i do , the more i figure out it is n't so great .
that part of the story was unfinished .
same with heroine 's father who was so cold it was not even realistic for a patriarchal society .
it was a let down to expect more of an in depth description of a character , but to get nothing more than a short essay .
there is no conversations between them .
it 's hard to sort fact from opinion and trust any of her pronouncements . some of the recipes have a lot of ingredients .
the man has potential , but is n't there yet .
supposedly brad pitt 's onboard .
the device of her diary entries seemed rather juvenile for this adult .
it was rather boring in many places .
she never seems to pick up anything worth mentioning , yet so much is made of her psychic ability . what a disappointment .
i was quickly disappointed for several reasons.1 .
skye disgusted me , period .
i liked the characters but i found myself skimming rather than reading .
at least the plot is entertaining , even if at some point the plot starts to drag .
never could understand where the plot was leading .
the last couple of books have been lame .
but it was not out of any love for the man .
but overall , it seems to be written more for the homeschooling parent than the youth .
the most obvious example of a religious group breaking the rules are the creationists .
i 'm sorry that i disagree with many and all the positive reviews here .
the characters were weak and the plot was non - existent .
this book i did not really enjoy .
there are many footnotes , but no effort to provide references , citations , or details to support the text that calls them out .
sorry but although this is an author recommended by my favorite publisher , it is definitely not my cup of tea .
for all the intrigue that could have taken place , i found myself largely disappointed .
sorry to say that i really disliked this book .
uninspired dialogue and story .
can you come up with a few cliches about lonely / misunderstood / oh - so - generous someones meeting their " soulmates ? "
the plot seems very shallow , no charactor development to remember and quite unrealistic .
and do n't get me started on the narrator .
and why was it even mentioned that the child was bi - racial if there was no intention to use that information to cause conflict ?
there certainly was n't any scientific evidence to support it occurring in this book .
i regret every second i wasted , and i hope others will not do my mistake of buying based on this books reviews , you 've been warned .
it was not written to guide mankind according to god 's desire .
i think these characters are really pretty shallow and the whole idea of this psychologist single handedly solving crimes and beating up bad guys twice his size is goofy .
ultimately i had to wonder why an essential about such a mediocre and obscure character was even made .
it should have been a huge fight and something should have happened .
do n't be swept up in this talk radio dreck .
i wo n't be so anxious to purchase her books anymore without reading a few reviews ... this is not her best work , rather boring actually
it was not a page turner nor was it interesting .
i found the story to be extremely predictable and the writing very wordy .
and i 'm disappointed that i invested so much time and money in this series ; it 's been a huge waste .
if it were n't so crystal clear that the tortured and convoluted plot was just a writing exercise for the author .
very disappointing to me .
a great idea , sorry that it was n't more useful for me .
i was just not at all interested in it .
the near - future setting had promise , but some of the descriptions felt repetitive and canned .
it is obvious that she is an abandoned child .
it made for a long , boring read . if you are into game - based books you might like it .
) , and the story did not improve from there .
there was nothing earth shattering about it .
this is awful ! ! !
it is also a little boring and mundane for me .
the basic premise of this book is that men hate going to church , unless they are particularly effeminate to begin with .
this book had language that was totally unacceptable and absolutely not necessary for the plot of the book .
the technical issues may seem unimportant to the average reader , but they detract from the experience of the book when they 're present .
a rather straight forward plot with little , if any , character development .
however , it is not written in an interesting way .
that were supposed to tie up loose ends did n't do the trick .
so , apparently endangering your kids and failing your duties as a mother is what you have to do to be a " biblical " wife by this author .
it is repugnant and boring .
somewhere down the line she started churning them out haphazardly .
it goes on a bit too long .
not that funny unless you are easily amused .
cd / abridged / mystery ?
i generally love books like this one , however , this story just did n't get it done for me .
it 's all pretty bad .
i found myself really disliking the husband in this family .
with a good editor and perhaps a better vehicle to relate the back story - at intervals - it might be entertaining .
at least nothing in this trade by creators i usually enjoy .
characters just did n't come to life for me , nor did the author 's writing style appeal to me at all .
the same punch lines , same jokes and same approach .
it is pretty predictable who the " other " man is going to end up falling in love with .
this novel would have received higher marks from me if it was n't so long .
log into [ ... ] - repeatedly .
the story is vague and leaves this reader with a question mark on the forehead .
i chose this rating because i was so bored with this book and it took me forever to get thru it .
the author chooses not to , and comes across as somewhat elitist as a result . i was confused by the author 's representation of her linguistic skills .
the seller described the discs as having " slight wear . "
the style of writing was confusing and boring and hard to follow .
bottom line : if you are a science fiction reader who prefers a diverting story , spend your dollars elsewhere .
but her decision to focus primarily on irresponsible never - married moms severely undermines her argument .
i would not say that reading this is a waste of time , only that i kept losing interest .
i can not even imagine growing up with this beast . she 's materialistic .
save your time and save your money ... otherwise i really liked it .
he just keeps repeating the questions . this book failed on just about every level for me .
that sounds good and was what i was hoping for .
they are empty fodder for a book with flat characters , insipid storyline , written by an author with no apparent imagination .
this book mediocre at best .
the premise was unique & promising and , like many reviewers have said , i really " wanted " to like this book .
if you are a competitive runner do n't bother .
the other stories were just ... ugly .
i hoped this book would help me understand what she is going through .
it just was n't fair ! !
what a shame that he wasted his money on this piece of trash .
the only point to the story is that people with money are just as trashy , if not more so , than people without .
the author is on the record saying he does not believe in hell , so apparently he can do what he does without fear of punishment .
deleted it !
i 'll get them from the library instead .
but as the book progressed i felt like i was missing a pivotal piece of information .
while i do accept that , you were obviously wrong .
unfortunately , instead of the cat and mouse game picking up steam , the story almost fizzles out .
he did n't have a face .
it 'll bore you and the ending is way too unbelievable .
all good writers require you to suspend disbelief but this book pushes you too far and does not deliver the goods .
somehow i could n't keep empathy for the characters .
it 's not one for the collection .
i think that this book managed to get published simply because of the author 's name .
the mocking of these to whom we owe so much of our comforts was entirely unnecessary and very disrespectful and was very off - putting for me .
i agree with other reviewers that the series is very silly and has declined .
i 'm not really sure what it was about this book , but most of it rubbed me the wrong way .
horrid rubbish .
perhaps , it was not saying what the ' author ' meant for it to say ?
there 's also not much of value for people who have any real outdoors experience .
in fact , despite the similarity of character names , much of the story 's reality was re - fashioned for the authors ' convenience .
the story seemed to drag on .
i 'm going to sell it at the used book store , maybe someone will like it .
i was expecting a sociological book on teens .
the author creates tax wonderful character , but fails to deliver on the complexities of the issue .
not to mention his family ... the reaction of her teammates and peers , singing group , etc . , come on ! ...
the hero was sullen & impatient & lady hero was selfish & spoiled .
if i had been able to return it , i would have purchased the printed version .
i ended up throwing both books away - i was n't about to donate them to our local library for anyone else to read them because they were so bad .
you still do n't care .
this author does not even follow the feeble attempt at dialect in the same paragraph ! !
many chapters / essays given over to her conservation agenda .
it is a stupid , stupid book .
if i were n't reading this for book club i would n't even finish it .
this repackaged western novel just did n't grab me .
to say i was disappointed in this book would be a generous statement .
i did get the whole background of the story but man what a snoozer .
" excuse me .
sadly , this never happened !
we may be motivated by the promise of money or other benefits , but sometimes we run into a wall .
i got very annoyed , hence feeling of wanting to throw the book .
the romance aspect was very thin .
and then all the sappy , goofy lines ? ?
but , even bad conditions are better than being in the middle of a war , or from what this book , says , no .
so disappointing .
this is a difficult review .
the plot was bad too .
it is certainly not much of a text on leadership or small unit tactics .
do n't be fooled by the laudatory reviews - which sound as though they were written by the author or her colleagues .
even as a white woman i find this tough to stomach .
the setting was well researched but lifeless .
i liked the brad / angela storyline , but it was very superficial and i wish it had gone deep enough .
it was also annoying that the author felt the need to use the title adverbs repeatedly throughout the book .
that 's not enough sophistication to hold a well - read audience .
excitement quickly turned to disappointment .
i do n't care what any of them have to say or do .
it is just boring .
i bought it because of the glowing reviews , but that was a mistake on my part .
just tried the sample .
having read everything on the internet that i could it was a rehash .
the hero was ok , but the heroine was lacking .
the author tries to walk a fine line : condemning the negative aspects of urban culture while not wishing to alienate herself from those who accept it .
surely , she does n't need the cash .
the contrived plot was just too convenient .
i can only tell you not to waste your money because it would be a big waste .
instead , they often seem like deranged toddlers , and that just made it too far - fetched for me .
it 's almost like he thinks maybe it 's gon na rub off on him .
problem : lots of secondary characters who come and go at such random intervals you begin to forget who they are .
their motivations are clearly drawn , but i lost interest in their problems after several grisly murders .
i did not like the world in which it was set .
i can see why people have enjoyed it for the premise , but the writing is difficult for me to deal with .
not worth the time for a mature reader .
no action , no sex , no nothing .
however , many readers will not finish this book because of the dry approach .
hardly any argument could withstand any neutral examination .
besides my problems with the story itself , the drawings are very primitive looking and the writing is less than eloquent . overall , not a good story .
this is just bad for women everywhere .
i 'm sorry , but i found this book extremely boring .
the hero is a completely underdeveloped character .
without being too graphic , it 's painfully obvious that the author has never experienced some of the more extreme sex acts he writes about .
if you want some depth to the story and characters , give it a pass .
he is extremely long winded , which made finishing a chapter before putting the book down to do something else almost impossible .
i might have better luck reading the copy in print , but i really do n't think that would help .
who talks like this ? ? ? ? ?
do n't inflict these on your child .
i think the idea although , pretty original in general was just overdone .
perhaps she tried too hard . i did n't feel like there was any closure in this series and that is disappointing .
did he just get tired or was there no way to finish ?
that costs money .
the recipes in this book are strange .
and since we 're on the subject of contrived , let 's talk about the story .
i was led to believe that you show character progression through action , not telling .
could not recommend this to anyone .
then to bring children into the story did n't feel too comfortable in this sex - infused world .
dies the fire is a terrific premise : what would happen if all the electricity and guns just stopped working ?
the constant repetition was annoying and the story line was uninteresting .
however , it did nt happen .
the book was really slow and kind of boring with a bunch of irrelevant chapters .
it was pretty boring to me .
and that brings up another point : nowhere is " god " defined .
it was a waste of time . not recommended .
( was it , perhaps , based upon advice from his editor , as a filler to make a book out of these essays ?
he was the worst ... a vile disgusting man that totally became worthy of having a wife .
so , what the crap is she doing trying to steal her childhood sweetheart from his wife ?
it just kept going on and on that even skimming did n't help .
i suppose that part of the problem is that i am into more benign mysteries and cozies vs. some of the more hard core crime novels .
i found it dull and at the same time troubling .
had high hopes for this book based on professional reviews .
do n't be deceived .
the story is entertaining , but sadly lacking in fact .
i mean he 's such a phoney . "
it makes the characters really flat and the action so uninteresting .
what a drag ! !
it got to the point i was skimming through pages because it was all repetitive .
and please , please get someone to proofread your manuscript , because your publishers are n't doing it for you .
sadly , she seemed to forget how to write her humorous and charming relationships along the way . trying to do a dual romance in this novel was a mistake .
i think i am a pretty intelligent person , but i had a very difficult time following this book .
great concept , but so , so poorly developed .
if the author was looking to be subtle , boy did you miss the mark . don't waste your money .
if i could go back i would have stopped at the last book as my crave for this series ended with this disappointment .
that is so unrealistic on so many levels , that it just made me mad .
why such a literary device for either this book or the original movie ?
hopefully this will be the only weak novel this duo will ever write .
sadly , i have to agree with others reviewers of this book .
let 's just stick with that , ok ?
it 's ridiculously biased .
do nt buy this for yourself and do not buy this for your children .
got bored reading the same story line .
why would he do that to us ?
the ghost appeared way too soon and was immediately ignored for no apparent reason .
this book was very disappointing , and i am not sure i would read another book from this author .
interesting concept , however the characters were flat , scenes were flat , and overall the story was flat .
i could n't figure out what was happening , who was who , or why i should care .
that does n't mean that we should n't hold them accountable .
( it 'll be dangerous .
i thought it was a great idea and not cliched or overdone .
i could overlook the typical convention of an angsty , teenage protagonist with a dead parent if said teen was n't a flat , cardboard cutout of a real person .
she contradicts herself and her ' evidence ' is very shoddy and at times , a bit ridiculous .
it was difficult to get emotionally invested in any of the characters whose motivations were wholly unclear .
unfortunately , these characters do n't behave like their species .
i certainly would n't have ordered a comic book ( graphic novel just a fancy name for comics ) .
at least i finished it , though i did skim the last several chapters just to get it over with . ah well .
sorry , not this one .
others should skip it and spend that money on something better .
i mean , is n't there one out there with an interesting addiction ?
mainly , there is no one to identify with and to like , not dragon or human . don't waste your money .
i was really disappointed in this title .
well , he was supposed to die but he does n't .
i did not really feel connected to the characters and was not engaged in the story .
actually because this book seemed even more dramatic , those chapters seemed even more tiring to read .
too many unanswered questions and dubious circumstances for me to believe any of it .
to the point that the bad guys had to seem like blind idiots to not know what was going on .
do they have left over thoughts that they throw together and call it a book ?
the storyline of this book is , at once , totally absurd .
super bad .
characters are n't interesting .
do the authors just not want to give up the money ?
this books needs a major editing .
i guess if you want a novel , then it 's okay .
a strange girl who looked like my dead ex ?
this book is riddled with stilted and stiff dialog , mostly coming from the mouths of the bad guys .
there was not much dialogue in this book which was also annoying .
far fetched and totally unbelievable .
it was not a good story .
she need to come up with better story lies
why 'd i read it ?
it 's another one of those books that are just alright , it 's nothing i have n't read before .
they all seem to be saying and acting the way they 're ' supposed ' to - not how a real person would .
maybe my problem is that i am not a big fan of the genre .
i did not like the characters whatsoever .
what i got , however , was nowhere near what i expected . i do n't know if the tryst was hot or not .
apparently people listen when he rants about politics .
this book has not inspired me to read any of the others by this author .
but , then , what would they write on to make money from books ?
the story line could have made a really good novel , but it 's written very naively .
if she were a real person , i do n't think i would enjoy spending time with her and her angst at all .
flash is clearly unsatisfied with the status quo , but does n't bother to explain why .
nevermind that they mention many planets and such , leaving the reader to guess where they might be .
but once the heroine and hero got married ( which by the way happens too early in the story ) it just got so boring .
the layout alone for the kindle edition is confusing .
it could just be my personal opinion but i did n't like the author 's writing style at all .
it seems so because no other motives were apparent .
i 'm not sure why he believes that he loves her as he does n't really know her .
i thought the whole concept was too far fetched for my liking .
he then repeats that statement for emphasis .
found the book to be a bit boring .
the language was nice , but the plot was not .
i could not make myself finish .
but i found the book disappointing on a number of levels .
there was no passion , no early interaction causing curiosity , confusion , interest , desire , lust .
but even though the appearances of the spirit were well done , the actions were completely predictable .
a middle - brow spy thriller , okay for the beach , i suppose .
this was the most boring book that i 've ever read , bar none , and i 've read a lot of boring books .
while i knew that butterfly collecting was part of the book , i did n't need the detailed descriptions of the species to further slow down the story .
the narrative 's style owes nothing to austen , and the dialogue is occasionally jarring with its use of modern slang .
if it happened once , it should n't have happened again .
if this book came with a money back guarantee at least i could get my money back .
some of the characters and plot threads were unnecessary to begin with , given too much emphasis for no apparent reason .
the way he prevented her from leaving really bothered me .
as long as he is spewing party - line propaganda , his books are worthless to a suspicious public .
this book is completely inappropriate .
however , i was n't bothered too much because i did n't care about the book or the characters .
but a very poor tribute , as the literary quality of this work is entirely lacking .
in fact , i doubt he even re - reads what he writes , otherwise he would not use the same words again and again and again ad nauseam .
he then used this money to finance his decadent lifestyle .
i did n't make it to the mid point of the book . my advice , save your money .
clearly the concept has some appeal , but the love story setup is so contrived that it becomes insulting to the intelligence of the reader .
some is not .
the killing of innocents ( women and children ) is mentioned , but at no point did i infer the author admitting in participating in such activities .
i was so angry and felt this ending was rushed .
the smug attitude of the author does n't help either .
what 's the point of writing a sentence like that ?
* * * this novel is filled with pseudo - intellectualism .
what a bunch of sticky , gooey , syrupy drivel .
i find her boring .
the book starts out slow and tedious .
unfortunately , it seemed to me like not much happened in this book .
instead i found a bunch of outdated stereotypes regarding men and women .
an attractive female archeologist , a handsome army special forces guy , and a vampire priest with a shameful secret are the main characters .
the plot is unbelievable , and it is simply trash .
not for me , but maybe for others .
that is not just a judgement on someone 's drinking problem or lack of personal ambition , that is a judgement on someone 's worth as a human being .
so trite , ( yawn ) so boring .
there was not a single character who did anything not expected .
i did not care for it at all .
( old man 's war may or may not be a socialist vista ; the reader has not a clue . )
the writing is awful and repetitive .
it should be called " ridiculous " .
when i finished this novel , the one and only thing i could ask myself was " why ? "
i suspect people that are decent dancers may find useful information here .
but i feel bad because of the sensitive nature of the topic .
i understand why the typesetting was messed with , but i do n't think it added much to the book , other than increasing my annoyance .
it is awfully tiring .
while the plot did hook me , i 'm actually not sure why , because there were so many clues that i figured it out long before the characters did .
it is offensive enough to be stupid , and not gritty enough to transcend cliche .
perhaps if i were a high school student , this book would resonate with me but it did n't .
absolutely superficial .
i deleted it after on a couple of chapters .
this is the only book by this author that i have read and it does not encourage me to read any others .
i forced myself to finish this book just so i could be completely fair in my review , but this was a tremendous disappointment .
do not buy this information ! !
there was nothing unusual about the book in any way .
but - geez louise !
why do we need a " comeback " book ?
the pathetic thing is that you can spot most of the fake reviews with very little effort .
got to be very boring .
not the book you want to encourage a child to ski .
do n't recognise the name ?
i also found a lot of it really predictable with a lot of very flat characters .
i tried , i really tried , but this was just too dry and academic .
and it 's not here .
i suppose that 's a minor point .
i was so , so misled by the description of this slow moving sleeper .
i should have stopped with this book .
i could n't wait to read this book but found it very disappointing .
unfortunately this reading by the author is n't all that great .
very amusing perhaps , but not what it said on the door .
just repetitive nonsense .
unless you are dying for a horror - medical mystery , i suggest you skip this one .
her track record is just too good .
i expected better .
for the story gets worse .
there was nothing romantic about it .
not for me though .
otherwise , not so much . spoiler alert : i ca n't describe all the problems without giving away key points .
it was tedious and the plot was absurd .
the authors did this big time here .
i am really disapointed in the author and do n't understand why she would do what she did .
i felt the ending could have been better and it was a bit of a cop out .
it 's confusing and frankly boring .
maybe i 'm getting jaded .
but that 's a cop - out ; many authors write about characters who are foreign to them .
i started this novel with high hopes .
with a few modifications , the story could just as easily have happened elsewhere .
( although , instead of " needs , " i should write " sexual desires .
i had to go back several times and reread parts of chapters just to try to understand something that happened .
listen , life is short , this book is too long .
this often happens when authors are attempting to write a classic instead of just writing a book .
also , while the author admits that the novel is not written using the standard grammar as its template , i could not ignore the many typographical errors and editing issues .
does not satan masquerade as an angel of light !
this book lacks any inspiration and comes off as ego masturbation more than anything else
it took way too long for the characters to even realize they cared about each other and the sex scenes seemed forced .
i could write an entire book about how bad this one is .
i read it for a book club , otherwise i probably would n't have finished it .
i do n't know what the hype was about this book .
however , if you like heavier mysteries that weigh in on the philosophical side then this might be something you would enjoy .
this book is not about god and should not have god in the title .
i finally made myself finish it by skimming through most of it .
what 's wrong with a child having a parent next to them to fall asleep ?
i can even accept that with clever manipulation of camouflage but just mind wiping and disappearing is almost too much .
my loss was to buy this trash
what i 'm trying to say is , fat empowerment really is n't a safe thing .
very odd book .
i could n't enjoy the book because i could n't read it .
why spend all this time on the person and take it away from the arguments ?
the premise is dumb and the characters do n't behave realistically in my opinion ( e.g.
after a while it became very dull .
the main audience for this book are people who like all that chakra / astral vibration jazz .
i did n't understand what was going on most of the time .
horrible , absolutely horrible .
this book had no humor .
plus , it seriously lacks in spiritualism , which is inseparable with psychic phenomenon with me .
kids should get the message that crime does n't pay , not that if they run away that 's good enough .
the facts indicate that he does not exist .
the whole premise of race relations was lost in the long winded character descriptions and flashbacks .
for me , this installment just was n't all there .
keeping up the horizontal self is obviously impossible .
i ordered it for my husband and he was disappointed also .
however , it failed to deliver as the pages turned .
this is not the way a trilogy of books is written .
that was the worst filler possible and should n't have been in there at all .
not to mention much complaining of his vet bills .
i just finished this book and i was disappointed .
it is not orthodox in any confessional or historical sense and only generous given the authors assumptions .
he starts with a theory , but he does n't actually prove it .
the book starts out with an interesting premise .
very unrealistic and not acceptable .
do n't get me wrong , i knew there would be vampires .
maybe other people really like this world , but for me , one was more than enough .
i do not think the stories complimented each other very well and i did not care for all of the stories .
however , the continual references to various " higher powers " and the underlying message of the lack of true " hope " was very disturbing .
maybe like that .
this is supposed to be some literary masterpiece , but i think it is pretty bland and unoriginal .
bored now .
she 's boring , everything about her is boring .
i only forced myself to finish it because i paid enough for the paperback .
the writing is very elementary .
emperor 's new clothes -- ai n't nothing there .
but how did it come about ?
this is no more than an extremely hollow , uninformative , mindless infomercial .
but why pretend this is fantasy when it is a religious novel .
too touchy , feely for me .
absolutely the thinnest , flimsiest plot imaginable .
it 's a shame that it was n't written by an author with sufficient talent and imagination to write a good book about it .
there was no love , no developing relationship , just , " i hate you " " no , i want you in my bed " .
the only thing i found mildly interesting was her telling of some of the dialogue between her and her author .
this is when i stopped reading .
there is a picture of a prayer book , printed upside down , so i guess there was no competent editing either .
the denouement is anticlimactic , basically an afterthought .
how does writing this bad ever get published ?
for more information , see : [ ... ] [ ... ] [ ... ]
this book is a stupid waste of your time .
prime time just happened to be a book which was n't of interest to me , personally ...
there are similarities between pagan religious teachings and christianity , but this does not justify the faulty conclusion that christianity borrowed from the pagans .
but it was filled with crappy , stiff phrases .
but she 's worse .
sorry , chuck , but ' saved by the bell ' was just a geeky tv show for kids .
i did n't really know what this was but it was not what i expected .
what a wasted opportunity . it 's hard to believe this piece of fan fiction was penned by a professional writer .
this is not -- it 's just kind of boring .
i lost interest about halfway through .
i could n't have stuck through to the end without that .
this is not mentioned .
i skipped over a what seemed to be a lot of pages just to advance through book .
no , he was not .
but " what is going on ? "
the arguments for theism seem irrelevant .
the point is simple : mental processing is flexible , at any age .
for those who study foreign languages you know what sort of headache you get after spending too much time with the foreign vocabulary .
unfortunately , the endnotes are the only interesting part of the book .
the storyline is predictable ( although most romances are ) and lacked any excitement whatsoever .
that did n't happen here .
aside from the fact that the story goes nowhere , nothing ever happens with the main character which is even more of a let down .
i simply gave up finishing the book .
unfortunately , while that quote is technically correct , the actual anecdotes that follow are very few and very far between .
that is not opinion ; it is indisputable fact .
he seems to put at least some of the blame on pornography .
seems sex is forced and twisted to get attention , rather than enhance the story .
the book was terribly edited as if spell check was never even used .
" , " why wo n't she give me money ?
unfortunately , this book was simply not for me .
i was open to just about anything , but nothing was said about a plague throughout the whole book .
characters are cardboard cutouts .
it 's just a flowery , over - wrought , boring romance novel .
it is n't explained in the book much better than that .
i was very let down and disappointed and so was my mom .
i 'm afraid this prestige is all but lifeless .
i am an old house junky and wanted better illustrations as example of the styles described .
if it does not grow , do n't eat it .
she does get more energy toward the end , but before that she 's pretty generic what 's the use of a character who could be just anybody ? .
i might believe a senator blowing up a school , but to expect me to believe a bully and her victim become buddies is just too much !
very boaring and very lacking in the craft of writing this book is .
language -- the author went for authenticity to the detriment of the book .
the red tent was an ok book .
it is boring to me .
not sure who the target audience is : adolescents ?
rather , it is a religious tract .
ella becomes a shallow , superficial character who cares more about her fancy clothes even though she seems to recognize what a brutal tyrant her care - giver is .
this is a heroine ? ? ?
" it 's a cute idea for a story but the writing is n't very good .
i ca n't believe people on here are actually saying this is a good book ... it is not ... do not believe them .
it 's predictable and cynical . another major problem with the book is that it 's very difficult to understand and implement on its own .
too many people die for stupid reasons to simplistic for them to really die for .
i ca n't even explain what i was expecting just anything more that what was given .
the chapter titles and table of contents conceal rather than reveal their content .
otherwise ...
instead i was served up a convoluted and not very interesting tale full of literary references many of which were unfamiliar to me .
i tried to like this book , but yikes !
the moment i saw the cover and the author , i was excited about this title .
i did n't like will very much in this sequel , in fact , i really did n't like either of the love interests .
she as an author goes no where with her characters .
i bought the book with eager anticipation and am very disappointed .
it has a great setup , but the author wastes an equally great opportunity .
it was boring the story line had so much potential but in the end it disappointed me and i ca nt understand anybody liking such a dull story .
she jumps him and has sex with him , but she just seems like a door mat .
the story line is very weak and the writing seems forced .
maybe that 's what the author was going for but it struck me as unrealistic .
it just did not feel epic enough .
some nice moments , but more often then not , flat .
it was a real struggle to finish this book and was n't at all satisfied with the ending . the book starts out really good but goes downhill fast .
it was n't quite a manga and yet it was n't romance .
sadly , it was not at all compelling and really a chore to get through .
i had no way to know the print was so small before i purchased it .
the characters were cardboard - like , and unlikeable at best .
i read this book for a book club and it was very hard to get through .
the plot twist is not really interesting .
a wanted man is too predictable and really just a rehash of older storylines .
disliked it so much that i ca n't remember the name .
it started out okay , and then flopped .
as i said , this book was disappointing .
not in this novel .
it was one of those books where you skip pages of blah , blah and never felt like you missed a beat .
i 'm sorry to degrade something considered by many to be a classic , but i did n't really like this one at all ...
this is n't a bad book .
this book had some interesting tidbits but was written more for a child in middle school .
worst book of the series and by far the most easily ignored with no loss of context for future installments .
a few bites of each plate in a restaurant seems like a lot of waste .
read the whole thing but it really had no hold on me .
it was more of a rambling on the authors part .
basically , its just scanned pages of the actual book .
it 's like the author got tired of writing and just zipped it to a close .
most likely i wo n't finish it .
the plot is no longer believable or relatable despite suspending my disbelief for the stories . also , the language used in the books is atrocious .
they spent too little time together so i was confused as to when they fell in love with each other .
no -- do n't recommend it at all as a cookbook unless you 've got formal training or are a chef .
the characters repeatedly do the same activities over and over again ..... eat a meal , go shopping , or visit an ancient temple .
the cast here is wholly uninspiring .
after reading the entire book i can not give a full physical description of the man , nor do i know much about him as a man .
this book was written by a very angry person who claims to have been wronged by a shady group that was after her , but no details were ever given .
i will not comment on too much of the specifics of the book because i should not spoil the reading .
at least this one does not .
no idea what keeps the male interested in her , except for the sex ? ?
this last person is around for the whole book , but not as the central figure .
instead , she 's constantly nurturing her brothers .
please save your money .
what that means from a reader 's perspective is that the plot jumps all over hell and creation , which made the storyline a mess and hard to follow .
i do n't feel like the characters have distinct voices .
this started with interesting characters and action -but the quality of writing was fair and the story went downhill .
i agree with them .
incredibly slow and dull .
if the plot has become this watered down there is obviously nowhere else to go .
i was pretty bored throughout and while you want to root for the sisters , the author does not absorb you in their lives .
but this book could n't capture me .
i found myself skimming over pages of fat , looking for the meat .
if you 're looking for something any more in depth than that , you wo n't find it here .
i do like this author though i just did n't care for this book .
sadly , i do n't believe that was their intention . thankfully , i am not the only person left with a bad taste in their mouth .
( i 'm not opposed to sex in books , this just was n't written very well . )
it had too much profanity and the sex scenes were too graphic for me .
that bit ended very sweetly , but on a false note .
the story is so overwhelmingly depressing that i can not imagine anyone enduring such a horrible life .
i think there were too many story lines going on .
initially this seemed like the kind of romance that i usually like .
the timing seemed very odd , and it did n't fit the story .
but according to the author of this story , there used to be lots of these rangers .
were there an option for no stars or minus stars , this would - be suspense novel would fall into that below - acceptable category .
that is why i wanted the book .
other than the connection of certain individuals attending meetings and then a coincidence that something happened afterward .
unfortunately they were dashed quite early . by the way , the movie was superior .
obviously , the story was fabricated in order to impart the author 's philosophy .
i did n't finish this book because i did n't feel attached to the characters at all .
i 'm a conservative , but this was a waste of time and money .
this was not an enjoyable book to read on any level .
nothing new happened in it for me .
it is hard to follow .
they just do n't have a right to drag the rest of us down too .
it 's as if books teaching how to " skim " were n't selling enough copies .
i did n't get the humor .
since i was reading about why these things were funny , it was very frustrating not to be able to see them !
he is mean , rude , and all - around awful .
she was taken aside and warned by other students that the teacher was sleeping with all the female students .
i got tired of reading the same thing .
his idiosyncrasies , background and current situation do n't gel . it got worse when we were introduced to his immediate boss .
do not recommend seller but so recommend product .
for that to happen , more money would have to be printed , which would mean hyper inflation .
i could not stop myself from yawning the whole time .
there are no " human puppets " or block figures .
do n't drag it out !
after you read it you are not really sure what actually happened , it just seems to go away like a bad dream .
it 's absurd , i know , and it 's not what is written in the book and it was not how it was .
i found the greater part of this memoir uninteresting .
if what a prophet proclaims in the name of the lord does not take place or come true , that is a message the lord has not spoken .
very poor choice .
the characters are strong but not as developed as they could be .
it was so convoluted , i found myself aggravated rather than scared .
way off target .
did not like the main character because no one can be that nasty .
his other book which had been made in to a film had left me expecting too much .
it is nothing more than a romance novel .
while these descriptions are often well written , in the end , i felt like they were a waste of time .
did i learn anything from this book ?
this one is way too esoteric and really not on point of pragmatic speed oriented work .
the plot was vague and the conclusion unsatisfying .
there was really no acceptable reason for waiting that long .
if it had been well written but unfaithful it might have been interesting .
it has no redeeming qualities of any kind , and has no real reason for being .
i especially have a problem with the length of the book as it seems many episodes are repetitive .
i was more disappointed by this one thing than by anything else in the book .
luce tries to break any sort of contact with him , especially as he is constantly rude and mean to her .
rambling implausible story from a formerly gifted author !
most of this book is a waste of time .
" the social world of financial elites , as depicted in this book , is simply too exaggerated to be credible .
turns out this story is being turned into a tv show , which might explain the overall unfinished feeling .
did it make that much more sense if you 'd been reading stuff up until this ?
the teen - age girl that figures prominently in the story is foul - mouthed , foul - tempered , and frankly quite unlovable .
there were so many loop holes and the characters did not stay true to themselves .
it is only a .99 read , so i did not feel that bad about trashing it when i was done .
i was a little dissapointed when i received this book .
i was not impressed with magical protecting wards or conjured balls of light .
" this book is , beyond a shadow of doubt , a polemic .
rehashing old , pre - series events based on the misunderstanding of one word ? ) .
while it is very well researched , this book is cliche and boring .
i bought this books based on the reviews .
most of the actions and conversations just do n't make any sense to me .
but , the finished product is inconsistent , full of unrealistic , incomplete , undefined and erratic characters .
depressing !
this book is crass and poorly written .
the former reviewer said the ending was great ... the ending left me extremely bereft .
the story was all about telling the reader what the characters were rather than showing them through having the characters actually do stuff , so everyone came out as flat .
in fact , there were times i did n't want to finish it .
the author implies that these people , her characters , are worthy only of condescending amusement , at best .
but i 'll wait until it 's at a close - out price so the author wo n't profit . it lacks any info on the later music .
however the faithful seems to be more likely to ignore the larger concept and prefers to be curiously selective in his or her reading .
instead , potential plotlines are disappointingly dashed aside .
i could have cared less if they had ended up together or not .
frankly , not a single development suprised me in the least , either by what transpired or why -- or even how .
if you 're looking for a replacement to your old style , almost pamphlet like canning guides , this is not it .
for that reason alone , i thought i would enjoy this novel , but i was utterly disappointed .
the matter of the letters is left in the air , and the whole book becomes a disappointment .
i dunno -- i see that other reviewers gave it high marks , which is fine , but it just left me mostly bored .
neither of these were " oh my gosh , i 'd never thought of that ! "
.if .
however , raising her " sister 's " child has matured her quite a bit .
unfortunately the kindle version lacks a cd for reference , also the included charts are unreadable on kindle , i would recommend the print version .
i found her very bland and immature and just all of the place .
however , rhyming feels forced and the tempo uncertain in the wording .
i do n't like the porn scenes at all .
it ends short and strange too .
oh , please .
clearly powers has a talent for prose and his descriptions are lyrical ... but the plot advances much too slowly and i failed to care about any of the characters .
it did n't matter to me if they got together or with someone else .
well , this was a lesson learned , for sure . my biggest problem with the book was that it was boring .
i had hopes for this to be a good book .
i was determined , however , to stick with it , thinking that eventually i would see what those who wrote the glowing reviews had seen .
but it 's frustrating to finish the book with a sense that the author just does n't care anymore .
it was just too damn slow and boring .
as other reviewers wrote , the trip back to the island took so long and was drug out with long talking and inner thinking passages that it became tedious .
eve just seemed vacant .
there are better authors out there who take the time to check their facts .
and are staccato , repeating one after the other .
this book has such promise : the subject of pornography is relevant and obviously personal to the author , but the end product fell far short of expectations .
does n't that creep anyone else out ?
crocheting is not difficult to learn and yet this author makes it sound very hard .
but i think she chose a terrible path in which to do so .
there is just no excuse for spreading that kind of ignorance .
this is poor evidence of any commitment to accuracy .
perhaps it did , but his self pity is completely misplaced .
this time lonely planet is your worst choice .
this " method " including " twirling " your hands , does not make sense to me .
i do n't care if it is tracked using the latest technology or targeted with advanced military hardware -- it can not die .
i have no idea what happened here and how it happened .
same quotes same dialogue , same everything !
the novella does n't have much going for it .
she is just the stereotypical , little , mean - girl , blonde , who was born with a silver spoon in her mouth .
but i found myself in a vegetarian book .
even if i 'm not that interested anymore .
it 's just that this story seemed to have gotten away from her .
do n't understand why you feel the need to incorporate that smut to make the story better when it actually makes it worse .
i am insulted that the authors thought so little of their fans and customers that they subjected us to this poor excuse for a novel .
why does the hero always have some lame nickname to do with the devil ? ? )
another more basic issue , at least for me , is that the story just did n't seem plausible .
let us look elsewhere for guidance .
i do n't know if the other reviews are done by friends of the author , but this book was poorly developed and poorly narrated .
the last example is the error of the convenience of facts , which riddle the plot(s ) .
so i could never quite care about them .
i felt like i was trying to memorize a translation book .
it was the aftertaste that bothered me .
there is no magic formula for this .
i normally am not a very picky person .
i ve had that work fine with other kindle code books but this one fails .
i had been wondering why i could n't seem to find my bliss .
i would avoid people like that .
there are better ways to spend your reading time .
i tried a couple of the projects and they do n't work right .
pictures are okay , pretty cute , but not enough to make my baby interested in it .
he 's just a foul - mouthed and manic cipher .
this one misses the mark for me .
the style of writing by the author is tedious .
do n't waste your money folks .
it seemed like there was too much description and explaining about what was going on with the characters .
that is a sign of failure .
but , unfortunately .
i guess when authors do n't have a lot to say they hide behind buzz words hoping readers wo n't get it .
it claims that it is almost certain that there is life on other planets .
either i 'm reading too many of these type of books , or she is writing too many of them , one or the other !
i would not recommend this book to serious readers .
most of her narration is in short , choppy descriptions of action with very little of her thoughts or motivations .
is unimpressive .
this review probably says more about me than the book .
the characters did not seem to connect and there was not any interaction that showed that love was developing .
they did n't seem to even really care for each other beyond sexual attraction , and even that was n't very exciting .
it just did n't seem that deep to me .
but overall , i would n't recommend anyone read this book , there are better reads out there .
i just feel like i want to warn people about how bleak and depressing this book is .
most said they did not like this book either and was boring to them .
this book is awful ! !
the why is never explained .
is this research ?
there were pages upon pages of set - up for nothing particular to happen .
why oh why did my boy v have to get the shaft with his mate ?
i just ca n't relate and like a character that has no interest in liking herself .
instead , it was hell , not eden .
is there anything she ca n't do ?
but , a book long on marketing hype and short on real revelation .
the plot was interesting , but it was kind of drawn out .
the girls had no goals , so they could not be faulted for making no effort to reach them .
this book is a waste of money and some of the suggestions seem dangerous .
the author spends entirely too much time convincing me he is knowledgeable enough to be trusted ( over and over and over ) .
this book is disappointing and a waste of money .
the same list of poets repeated ad nauseum . in short , do n't waste your time on this .
who gives a crap if he s good looking ?
too much s&m and not enough story for my liking .
the message behind the story bothered me to .
a friend recommended it and since we have similar tastes i figured i should check it out .
purgatory is being threatened by horrible storms . i had major issues with this book and finally gave up not willing to force myself to pick the book up again .
actually i did n't even bother to finish it , because it is such a waste of paper and time .
even the sadism is immature and uninteresting , more outlandish than shocking .
i prayed all her other work was similar ..... not !
was not worth the cost .
( or his ghostwriter ) is trying too hard to add depth to the character .
it was a big waste of money and time !
the characters are n't too deep .
the main character is repulsive with no redeeming qualities .
sadly , it all went downhill from there , with cliche after cliche after cliche .
these letters are very repetitious .
so why does nothing happen ?
however , this does not mean that she should completely rewrite history .
why should a book be big and long to be any good ?
i did not realize this was a novel .
after this twist , the direction of the story takes a hard left away from the initial premise .
why bother wasting more time ?
i agree with both of these points . the writing is incredibly lazy .
dumb book
the alternative world concept seem very poorly thought out - there are tantalizing glimpses to differences , but that is all there are .
the bottom line is i got through the book but wanted to strangle sara ...
its so disappointing .
maybe she needs some time off , or maybe i do .
talk about overly - descriptive , useless information .
i was just like , " huh ? ! ? " .
fell asleep everytime i tried to read more pages .
the show implied that he was providing drugs for some of them but it also seemed that he got a producer credit .
this is n't a book about clear communications rather it is a primer on how to use language to manipulate your audience .
maybe they were too young .
this book seems intent on confusing the reader , and by making them confused force them to either accept everything the cult leader says , or run the other way .
i mean , none of the characters have enough personality to fill a paper bag much less help create an actually decent plot .
book needs a little editing .
a few times i did this and realized that i was n't missing anything important by not reading a few pages here and there .
my husband and i were both really looking forward to this , and we 're just disappointed now .
i just could not get interested in it .
i would not purchase this cookbook .
this book suffered from the same problem .
the book is just a tedious read .
this can not be !
this book just did n't hook me like many of her other books have .
i understand that the publisher does not think that a bunch of articles focused on measuring inequality will sell .
even the " love scenes " are repetitive .
i felt it was to long and too much from a ' not so bright ' male point of view .
i was really hoping this would be a good book and help me out but sadly it is not .
other reviewers have called it " boring , " and i strongly agree .
i like the recipes , but the story is so hackneyed it had to be made into a movie .
it gets sickening after a while .
but this book moved so slowly that i just could n't get into it .
okay , i 'm not fat myself , but i can see that books such as this do not help women and girls who are overweight .
cute word - play just was n't enough to carry this poorly written book . i do n't think we 'll look into the rest of this series .
if i did n't know any better i would n't think the same author wrote this book .
this is not an original story .
perhaps they do n't want to be wrong .
it is correct , but it produces a very strange robotic effect to the book .
i did n't care about any of the characters and could find nothing remotely compelling about the storyline .
i mean , ( note to author -- did we really need this ? )
in so doing he destroyed the famous merry - go - ground to which the unicorn belonged and ' ruined ' the village 's prosperity .
too much , and it felt tacked on .
pretty boring , rotten read in my opinion .
the ending is rather ambiguous and quite a letdown .
he frequently threw out random thoughts about movies , songs , etc .
many of the characters were difficult to recall , and i found myself constantly referring to the glossary or previous books in the series in a desperate search for clues .
most chapters are n't related to one another .
some readers have said that the premise of the novel , young lawyer blackmailed to steal firm secrets , was promising but i would argue the contrary .
i 'm not sure why i suffered through this travesty of a novel .
that would have been nice to know . and then , it all got worse at the end .
it is dull and bland and tells us nothing and summarizes what we 've already heard from other resources .
the problem is that it is trying to cover too wide a scope with all types of companies .
i am very dissappointed in the shape of this book .
i got to the story of how she killed her horse ( actually could not finish that chapter ) .
i did not find the book particularly scary , and while it started with a bang , the pacing seemed to drag in parts .
not his best offering .
it is not your soapbox or your diary .
toward the middle of the book i could n't wait to finish it not because it was so interesting but because it had no substance at all .
it 's another to write for people you clearly think are idiots .
her characters are a joke , & the stories are just so amaturish , it is impossible to read them with a straight face .
i could n't get past the prologue .
not sure whether this story is more memoir than tale , but large parts are really extremely tedious .
maybe the ending redeems the rest of the book , i do n't know and i 'm not sure if i 'll ever finish it .
he does n't care about that , either -- his opinion is that if you think he 's a jerk , you 're an idiot .
the plot was fine , but the characters !
the writing style is just not good .
horribly awkward and what ? ? ? ?
she might have been better off starting where the other story left off , writing the events in a consecutive order .
too much to the story .
" i 'm not kidding that 's the entire first half of the book .
which is sure to be a worthy read , not this garbage .
too much information is bad for a story , and it bogs it down .
i 'd rather they had simply published the notes .
i could n't even finish this book . don't read this book .
i liked how it started out , but it got too confusing with the different story tellers .
the authors claim that somehow , if you merely watch " what is " with a curious attitude , your bad habits or unhappiness will fall away .
a good idea very poorly executed .
i could not get past the clumsy writing and had to move on to a different book before my head exploded .
the guy leaves his wife for some woman .
i know her legions of fans will take offense over this opinion , but i tried so many of her books and have found they are formulaic and poorly written .
this is not special .
the simple fact is that the story just is n't interesting to me anymore .
and this book sorely did not deliver .
it actually really annoyed me .
to me , they felt rather forced and heavy handed .
i could n't and would n't finish it .
save your money and precious time and pass on this novel .
like other reviewers have said , it reads like a college essay .
i realize that some of them were part of the plot , but they certainly did n't need to be that long and descriptive .
usually i do n't really think about those things , but here the poor writing and cliches are all over the place .
i skimmed most of the book as it was repetitive and did n't contain much new material .
the others were fine so far , but this one is so terribly boring to me .
and let 's forget his psycho - babble nonsense : this book was written to appeal to ( or take advantage of ? )
in summary , i was hoping for some character development , but i was disappointed .
the book was hard to get through , not only dry , but not well written .
i felt weaker .
i would not recommend this book , i thought it would be an interesting expose but it was not .
i run money .
the ironic style seemed pretentious .
how could it get worse than no plot whatsoever ?
so much bs is riddled within her words .
and believe me , there 's very little that comes out of her mouth that sounds mature . as for a story ?
let me say right off that this is n't the worst book i 've ever read .
i 'm not one for long descriptions and this book goes on for pages until he gets to the point . tiny dancer
i guess ? )
it 's insulting to everyone .
and if there is an ultimate authority , other than myself , then ... uh - oh ... one can try conforming desire to truth , or truth to desire .
every single item , and object that is insignificant to the plot does not need to be described in excruciating detail .
friends have told that some of her earlier works are better , but there was n't enough here to convince me to try .
probably a gold digger . save your money .
in another word : pathetic .
i 'd been looking forward to her accidentally ripping a few doors off their hinges or putting her foot through the car floor trying to brake .
however , the authors should consider repackaging this book as historical novel about the humanity that can sometimes be found in difficult world events .
it conveys nothing .
i have made repeated attempts to get into the story but i just can not do it .
but , trust me when i say this book is not worth your time , and certainly not worth the price .
so sad , i thought this was going to be a book that makes me like caroline again ... sadly i like her less .
i feel ripped off .
the locations did not lead to the pages i needed .
city of the dead was a waste of my time and money .
i have to admit that i was a little bit disappointed in this book .
i do nt like the heroine 's stubborn attitude either !
the author did not disappoint .
a poorly executed book that will make a lot of grandparents and mothers - in - law feel better without truly offering them the chance to change themselves .
he is mean , arrogant and ultimately incompetent .
this was the worst book i have read in a long time and i waited for so long to come out .
she was completely unnecessary .
" at this point , the chapter closes out .
there was no flirtation , no intensity , nothing was shown to explain why he 'd believe that .
would not recommend this book !
basically vey disappointing .
i was so bored by this story that i did not finish it .
i never connected with any of the characters and i did n't like the main character .
unfortunately , her ' husband ' has just been killed in battle .
does she somehow expect that it 's obvious , that she 's implied it through inference ?
i read the reviews before downloading this book but i should have read a sample .
it nauseated me to read and i saw no necessity to go into such graphic detail about many things .
just stopped reading it , not my kind of book .
they did n't flow together for me and i was just frustrated in general .
this book is entertaining but it was poorly written and full of cliches .
the shapeshifter was the only interesting thing , but even he did n't rescue it .
maybe it was purely for the cheese factor that i know is coming up .
this thing reads like it fell off the truck before seeing an editor .
read a chapter , and could n't get into it at all !
he has an inflated sense of self , hanging around ridiculous other boys who are nasty characters .
i can not believe the same author of that book wrote this .
the childhood upbringing did n't phase me .
i was not overly impressed with this one .
unfortunately , this book was so bad , she never finished it .
unfortunately , it 's nowhere near as good as the reviews here suggest .
this book has been summarized already by previous reviewers , so i wo n't rehash that .
" leave out the parts people tend to skip . "
and it just felt awkward as every single character of note is run back through the story for a curtain call .
i also normally do not throw away any books for any reason , but the contents of this book just threw me for a loop .
next , on to the red plague affair - for which i have high hopes , especially after this near - dreck .
( this one is on the bottom of the pile ) .
) , and i was excited to see the sequal come out in paperback . unfortunately , this one did not live up to my expectations .
he never even seemed man enough to me to rate as a hero .
read something serious instead .
he meanders , and at times his points venture off into disparate directions without a clear connection .
maybe a list of characters would have helped , that way when the author rambled on i could have a point to refer back to .
this book is basically saying one has no need for friends .
i feel sorry for any tree that gave up its life to be a book for this to be printed upon .
i have no further interest in this character and just could n't understand the course selected .
his dialog was horribly stilted ( to the max !
rather plodding pacing and not much of a resolution at the end .
this book fell back on clich&eacute;s -- hard .
i kept falling asleep !
the writing was terribly organized and there simply was no direction in thought .
not however , for the sketchy plot .
i 'm skipping it and the rest .
the problem with this book however is that there is nothing to tie the time lines together .
it is a rambling collection of impressions from a somewhat informed , but certainly untrained ( in archeology , history or anthropology ) , correspondent .
too much backstory , too much exposition .
huge coincidence ?
i just did n't like this book , and i really wanted to .
i could n't stand the writing style and could n't find anything interesting or redeeming in the narrator / protagonist .
i felt like the story was boring .
does n't that just go against the laws of nature ?
ok , so that actually was n't good ... now 's the good part .
a male playboy swears off of women .
i guess you ca n't really call this a review ...
i mean , it 's like educated chick lit .
a self - help book like the one minute manager that wraps the advice up in a little story to try to make it look better .
all these stories dragged and some were downright ridiculous .
" do n't get me wrong , the book was not entirely worthless .
reading this book was a waste of time .
make no mistake , hell is terrible .
she ca n't even get enough money to buy the drugs she needs to treat the natives , but fails to see the advantages of her good fortune .
how much is one serving of jerky , for example ?
lots of ideas are listed , but very few involve anything free .
regrettable should be the real tittle of this book . this book gets more irritating by the moment .
the story is lost in the barrage of label dropping the author uses to make the book seem more hip .
because products are bad .
let me start with saying it 's another stinking cliff hanger series book .
i found it offensive that a college educated woman would stay with a man who tells her over and over how he is going to f ... her .
it really is not worth the monetary expense .
it is a pointless , rambling piece of garbage .
did n't care for this book much .
i like reading about the 60 's , but was a little disappointed in the cookbook .
this one is definitely not one i 'd recommend to anybody , but it was n't so horrendous that i could n't complete it .
ultimately , nothing redeems the book from its overbearing style choice .
i can not , in all honesty , not recommend this book , for someone else may like it .
the book seemed to ramble with not much organization .
so why do we see " liberal - fascism ? "
the building premise for the serial killer had potential , but overall the whole thing reeked . bloody violence , sadistic rape , cardboard characters , cliched relationships
to be honest , i just did n't care for this one .
i would have expected nothing less mind you , but unlike having a good dictionary for other words , there were many terms to be found nowhere .
i only say that because it was not a story - it was a bunch of occurrences just thrown together on pages .
the thing seems to just be fixated on children and offspring as the point of unions .
if i were him , i 'd go after someone else .
it was soooooooooo boring .
there was no depth .
this could have been a great trilogy but sadly it just feels like a filler book that just stops !
rather pompous and disconnected and overloaded .
i found that section particularly depressing and not very well - written .
no rational , sane and supposedly intelligent person would behave the way the main character behaves .
i had a hard time finishing the book and never felt connected to either of the main characters .
it does n't offend me - to each his own - but what did offend me was how bad this book was .
what sort of nonsense is this ?
and do not understand popularity and strong reviews .
i did not understand this book .
what is that about people who can only be funny by using bad language -- lack of vocabulary or intelligence or creativity ?
the romance in the book was shallow and had no real life lesson .
not me , although i tried .
the book does n't go anywhere ; there is no payoff !
please , get yourself an editor who can get rid of all the fluff in your recent books .
hate the characters and mean plot line .
there were a couple of sweet parts in the book but it was not worth the rest to get to them .
i kept thinking , what was the heroine thinking ? ? ?
who would really believe that if i steal your dinner , i am actually serving you ?
his vocabulary is singularly juvenile , far below his alleged age , and his sexual view of every relationship makes him seem limited mentally .
it is so choppy i thought it is a joke .
i said she almost got her wish ; it seemed like it would never end .
truly , he cracks me up . this was a bit of a disappointment .
i must first start off by saying that the book was just an okay read .
let me start by saying that i like the premise of the book : flying children escape from evil scientists .
his writing was not as poor as some of the other true crime authors i have read .
not to mention the total implausibility for the kind of huge lab and sophisticated equipment needed for such a project being able to function in the jungle .
i just kept hoping it would get better .
they are harmless and truly mediocre .
because of that , the sex was tepid at best .
so why even bother ?
this book has to be the worst written book ever to slip through a publishing house for approval ... at least i hope so . the writing is horrible .
or for that matter does it sound like someone you want to know more about ? ?
it reads more like a " what if ? "
i collect scholarship texts , not this kind of garbage .
however , this book is worlds different from my usual romance plot / characters / dialogue and for me , it 's not for the better .
there is no need to make your child feel shame and remorse for performing a natural body function .
however , i found myself getting bored and not able to focus on what i was reading .
did n't hate this , but did n't necessarily like it , either .
i am not a prude by any means but reading stories with this kind of language is tiresome .
there were hints and then it was dropped .
and that was so disappointing . okay , so this was n't a favorite of mine .
and i do n't think it is just because we are pretty old .
the writing is juvenile at best , nonsensical at worst .
overall , highly disappointing .
i would have quit reading without another thought about the story but had to complete it for my book club .
every sentence has dumb words substituted for otherwise appropriate words in a sentence .
this book is n't even that .
this is basically all the book is .
granted i read them in the wrong order as this prequel came much later , but it does n't work for me on any level .
it 's messy and silly . the book is a very hit and miss affair with many , many , many misses !
moved too slow to hold my interest .
paragraphs after paragraphs of nonsense .
however , people did n't talk like that then .
i thought the description of the book but a bit over rated .
if this is the best he can do with all that time he has to write , it 's pathetic .
sorry , that 's my last rant .
there was nothing new to be learned about the era or the rescue effort of the slaves .
if i wanted to read them , i would have bought the papers .
no where does the author bother to discuss the question of the distribution of wealth -- not once does it address the question of who gets more and who gets less .
i do n't want to say that this book is horrible as it had a couple good points .
they did not seem to really reflect her life the way i thought they would .
i was * incredibly * disappointed , to say the least .
but i have never been so irritated that i felt a review was necessary .
i was really disappointed by this book !
it lacks any sort of suspense .
i probably would have stopped reading it if it did n't have so many good reviews .
i found the writing a little difficult to read at times , very choppy and dull .
mercifully the novel improves as it reaches its conclusion but , for the most part , this struck me as an exercise in self - indulgence .
i skimmed over a lot of pages trying to find something in order to drag me into this book .
fake sounding names , fake sounding reviews .
so far there 's nothing new here , and the characters are purest cardboard .
perhaps had i not been from this area i may have found the book to be a fair read -- but perhaps not .
progressives on the other hand reject this approach and opt instead to reward their buddies in so - called " green " industries .
in the end , i tossed it in the trash anyway as there were just too many pages torn out .
i saw some of the bad reviews here and almost did not purchase this book .
( or is it misinformation ? )
i actually paid money for this trilogy , and i 'm aggravated at wasting my hard - earned dollars .
i was n't impressed by this book .
very weak under any light .
seems he needed something to break up the historical parts that all eventually run out of steam when ( guess what ? ! )
it might have worked for someone who knows nothing about horses .
there was too much use of coincidence to resolve the plot line .
but , in the end , the story is just sad , does not redeem itself , and does n't leave you with any significant insights .
sorry -- i just was n't impressed .
it 's an okay story but if i had to do it over again , i would n't waste the time flipping the pages .
it was interesting but i left wondering what was true and what was not .
but from there it just starts down in to silliness .
i did enjoy some of the personal stories the author shared , but overall found that there was something too nice and superficial about it .
was this terrible book really written by the same guy who plotted such masterful thrillers as eye of the needle , and a dangerous fortune ?
i found the story line to be slow paced and continually repeating itself .
i 'm sorry , but the ending really does n't ring as a romance to me .
felt like words on a page and not a conversation .
the debasement , humiliation , and deranged sexual preferences made me feel physically ill .
mainly , repetition was unbearable .
the ending was terrible no awful .
not a lot of hope is left or achieved .
if you disagree with any of the author 's opinions , you are self - deceived .
( all of a sudden he 's obsessed with numbers ? ? )
( yeah like she could get through a background check ! )
it seemed too trite and not the best of writing .
in fact , it is the least of his that i have read .
i do n't require all heroines to be smart .
i do n't think there is any excuse for this .
there was minimal character growth and what little relationship development there was came across shallow .
overall , not her best work .
" down river " is very shallow as far as plot and characterization are concerned .
never could get into this story .
i took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt .
suffice to say , the book is not only unneccesary , it 's flat out incorrect in most spots .
i 'm really tired of her going on about how everything she does must be evil , and for no apparent reason .
maybe there 's something amazing to be had in these pages , but i could n't find it .
there is an obsession with male sex acts .
unfortunately so does the book .
small oversight , but still annoying .
however , i do not believe i will be reading that book , at this time .
this book falls firmly in the latter category .
would not even recommend it to the novice as i feel there are much better books available .
why could n't the official game guide have told me this ?
if you are lying simply to lie , the humor tends to get lost .
but other then that , this book is a joke .
( unless i 'm missing it every time i read the chapter ?
but to have your memory trivialized by such a hack must have him spinning in his grave .
if you read enough in the previously mentioned genres , you will have seen nearly all of these concepts used at least once elsewhere , and probably used better .
if she came out of retirement to write this book , i 'm afraid it was a mistake .
disappointing , garbled , disjointed " preview " of what is a wonderful story .
i 'm sorry to be so blunt , but there 's just no other way for me to say it .
this book is a rip off of just about every self - help book out there on the market .
it tries to cram it all in towards the end and suffers greatly .
to paraphrase : the world needs more good people that care about others .
this is why this book can not be gifted without a careful read through and additional updated information .
the book just did n't have enough of an interesting storyline to draw me in .
the title of the book is nonsense .
it just did n't make any sense .
while the novel includes some real people , places , and events , it relies heavily on fictional characters and fictional interactions , and uses some fictional genealogy .
i had just finished a disgusting part about ' feces man ' when the next chapter started with yet more of the same subject .
someone does n't know the difference between which and that -- and they 're not interchangeable .
because it 's unreadable .
so , it pains me no end to write this review and give the book one star just because of the price .
but this is only my opinion .
it was slow , not very exciting or intense .
my book club read this and i was so bored with it , so darn wordy !
not recommended if your child is at all sensitive .
it 's supposed to be all uplifting and such since the rabbit becomes real in the end , but instead i took away how callous and flighty people are .
i find that idea objectionable and offensive .
and , there were n't a whole bunch , but there were several spelling mistakes , or several where a word was missing .
however it became very tedious to read .
it just drags on and on
this woman can not write !
i like poetry too , but alot of what 's here seemed almost like random words thrown together .
this book got great reviews so i thought what the heck i will buy it .... ugh waste of time .
there was nothing to make this stand out differently .
i mean would you really " hiss " at the guy you truly desired ?
the demon in charge of the heroine asks her to recruit more good souls and stop having sex with only mediocre energy sources .
i 'm finding it hard to think of any other series ending i have been so disappointed in . this final book felt rushed .
the last few books seemed like the exact same thing .. changed a few words .
there are some goings - on between characters that i 've skipped over , maybe the book was about those .
and if you 're looking for realistic romance , skip this , too .
it was a bit repetitious and a chore to get through .
this story fell flat .
the ( awful , awful ) comic panels , side bars and tables only serve to clutter the pages and distract from the text .
emma seemed dull and at times a little dense .
i had to read it for school , but that is far from the reason i hate it .
characters were introduced but not developed in depth ... just a lot of pretty people living on a pretty estate ... not much here .
then it became apparent the subject was a very unfocused woman with wind blowing her hair .
writing this story from the perspective of a few well developed characters instead throwing a bunch of cardboard people in would 've made the story much better .
this book was of no help to me whatsoever .
almost gave it up halfway through - something which has never happened before .
she sounds like she 's reading in a drunken slur .
the major problem with the book is the concluding section which is totally unbelievable .
but i felt bad about watching the movie without reading the book , as , for some reason , i have a personal rule about not doing that .
she then said yes and , subsequently was shot and killed . unfortunately , it never happened .
do not read it ! ! !
i wanted to like this book .
do n't let the intrigue of this subject trap you into reading this very poorly written book . you will end up more confused and frustrated then enlightened .
perhaps she is unfamiliar with this saying .
if you really want to read it , find a copy at your local library or borrow it from a friend who was unfortunate enough to pay money for it .
it did n't really give any useful advice or examples of ways to love your wife better .
but the author decided to not finish the series , or lost interest ... or something ... so there is no finish to the story .
this book was very dull - i could n't finish it .
but there were too many people and too many twists or whatever and made it horrible .
i was a little disappointed .
though she constantly spoke of spirits and higher beings , it did n't feel religious .
i found it to be a rather drawn - out talker of a book .
the artwork seems a bit dated and the colors lacks any vibrancy ( is that a word ?
the author is a professor of linguistics , but he sure could use an editor .
tessa is innocent and boring .
i can understand where this concept might work for some kids , but i was very disappointed with the results we experienced .
it 'd be just as painful but not as long .
do the math : there are many characters we would rather not spend too much time delving into ; some cans of worms are just unappealing .
it is a waste of your money ! ! ! !
i just could n't get into the characters , partly because -- for me -- there was too much " romance " and too little history .
but it obscures a lot of what 's really going on , or has gone on in the past .
that 's what happened to me respect this book .
he told her to go to safety but he 's the bad guy ? !
frankly , you 'll have to be pretty dedicated .
less - developed societies are not necessarily more " natural " and thus " healthier " in their child - rearing practices .
the story arc seemed amateurish and unoriginal ... like an old detective serial where the investigative reporter quits his job to solve the crime himself !
and the thing that is up with that really really angered me because it is a cheap ploy to pull on your heartstrings .
not to offend the generation of gay men that this book presumes to speak for but it was whiney and pathetic !
it is too preachy .
he simply was not likable , he was never happy and he was constantly simpering and acting like he was the only one with legitimate problems because he was gay .
the premise seemed so promising but i 'm so disappointed with this dull attempt at a novel .
the rest of the story was so convoluted that i could n't keep up with who belonged to who , who was speaking , etc .
seriously thinking about returning it !
if archaeological evidence is inconclusive then why discard the accuracy of written records without question ?
2/3rds of the way through the book . there was an obvious throw in of a character for a forthcoming book .
or " hey , try this . "
i found it hard to follow , the characters did n't appeal to me ... well .... in general it was a disappointment .
because i 've enjoyed his books before , i really looked forward to this one but boy was it a disappointment .
i 'm sorry i actually purchased the book instead of using the library .
i do n't like to quit a book and will usually see it through .
but i also do n't think this means it all actually occurred .
bad book , horrible character development , poor understanding of real world problems by the author .
no way .
the plot was very good but the characters were not believable .
they obviously have sex frequently .
this is n't literature .
i tried like it , but it was not my cup of tea .
she just seems to drop the watch onto the page and presume that the reader will take the whole back story on faith , i suppose .
the same can be said of the main villains .
i never quite got into it , and actually tossed it before i even finished .
there is no there , here , only the market .
obviously the summons was written as a character study and not a thriller .
furthermore , the writing is stilted and lacks cohesion .
however , the story was very predictable .
not necessary and totally sending the wrong messages to teenage readers .
i picked up this title and tried getting into it .
of course , that story was not really in the theme , but it was good . most of these stories , however , are just not good .
it was a very interesting idea but there were just to many issues with it .
but i was completely disappointed .
the woman barely puts up a modicum of resistance when the man starts to seduce her even when she thinks that it 's just an act of revenge on his part .
the problem is in the pacing .
i was very disappointed with this book and it has nothing to do with the cliff hanger ending .
this book is childish and for those who have not developed much with their inner growth . a beginners step , quickly left behind
however the chronology , having made uncritical use of so many sources , is entirely inaccurate , as are most of the associations and events he tries to put in context .
i 'm not an overly tech savvy person but he lost me in several points .
except that this time our hero does n't come across as a genuine psychological case , just a self - serving bully playing victim to justify himself .
that was her down fall when she wrote the book , but overall i though it was an ok book .
i could have been ok with it being transformed into a standard love story if there had been some spicy love scenes , but no such luck .
unfortunately i could not finish the book .
someone would like to buy the book ?
nothing of import is really happening with the secondary characters and i found myself skipping around hoping there would be a point .
did n't grab me right away .
but other stories seem trivial and fragmentary .
too slow paced and too alpha male for me .
reads like a research paper .
perhaps i am mistaken , but i do not think any data set --- certainly not one so highly manipulated as this --- could prove otherwise .
it is certainly interesting ; i just did not find it pleasurable .
perhaps if the story itself and it 's plot were more developed the spiritual plot would not seem as forced .
the dialogue in the book was particularly bad and it was inconsistent .
there were left out quotation marks , spelling errors and just a whole bunch of problems that i could n't get over .
however , i 'm sure others will love this book . i received this book free from the publisher through the booksneeze.com book review bloggers program .
the ideas seemed thrown together haphazardly and the book was not organized very well .
i was shocked that so many professional reviewers seemed to love such a flat , poorly written story .
the author over - emphasized on so many thoughts , that i could feel my mind explode with the unnecessary explanations .
they are so small and light they are virtually unreadable , this flaw makes this book useless as an introductory text .
the book itself is not .
it had a lot of potential and there truly were some good moments .
nothing new in his plots , and a lot of rehashing of old plots with too much confusion .
i will not be buying any other books from this author .
on an electronic device , cross - references ( e.g. , page x ) should be links .
if there was a way he would have gone back to her after he was done with the heroine .
what a disjointed mess .
it seems shallow to me , , , i am very disappointed .
i love what not to wear , but i was very disappointed in this book , especially after reading the reviews .
it seemed like all the main warriors in this book were left hanging or forgotten .
why do i not like this ?
it was like the characters were taking huge leaps as to what a look or a face meant . then there were other little things like those below .
i preordered it , and when it came , everything else was set aside and i read it immediately . the book was flat .
i did n't like the useless info he talked about , traveling by train , who invented what .... i wanted him to focus on the story .
it was n't so terrible that i could n't finish it but it was so irritating that i was happy for all the interruptions i had whilst reading it .
my opinion of the dialogue varies .
seriously , someone needs to buy this guy a dictionary , and he needs a new editor .
ok , i was drawn to this by comparison .
but there 's really only so far that little subplot can stretch before it gets old .
mad reader would be a better title , this book has nothing to offer , no real plot , not anything .
the characters were weak and totally unlikable .
just to unbelievable .
maybe i 've been spoiled by the recent fantasy / sf i 've been reading , but i found the plot very slow moving , and generally uninteresting and uninvolving .
take my advice : do n't even bother borrowing it from the library !
seriously , this book is terrible .
this book was just too unrealistic ... to the point of down right corny ..
i wanted to relax with a book and not get upset about a book .
i found it incomprehensible , chaotic and boring .
i could n't help but think that she was a bit daft .
i have found this theme to be repeated in her novel his lady mistress as well .
i read this book all the way to the end , but that was because it was so ridiculous and badly written .
this book fails on several levels .
but ... this is nothing new as a philosophical idea .
so i did n't !
his work is becoming so formulaic as to be predictable .
the part i read was just not " together " ; so much of it was vague .
the synopsis sounded intriguing but it just falls flat .
i agree with almost all of the reviews .
way overly descriptive rather than interactive .
and let me tell you , it 's not good at all .
this series seemed to go downhill as the story went on .
the additional fluff is repetitive and intuitive and did not shed new light on much of anything to me .
i wanted a story i could enjoy getting lost in , and instead got something much too literary for me .
who would believe that after all the nastiness anybody would forgive such actions ?
this is a thinly veiled romance novel with a contrived plot and cardboard characters .
insulting attitudes for older audiences , yet alienating to younger ones , it just does not work . there 's better out there .
if so many people truly hate the book , why the movie ?
what i got instead was a book that refused to hold my attention .
yet tons of folks are buying the book . there seems to be little in this book that was not already known .
i could n't connect with it at all , which was sad , really .
i guess i was expecting more from this book .
just , do n't .
if not , i 'm done with him .
even their history , if they 're actually was one , is so thinly suggested as to be difficult to connect to their present little connection .
it seemed to take forever to get through this one .
whatever - i just found the book too disjointed & uninteresting to read .
there are conversations between these people -- as if these are really important characters -- boring .
i found it to be a total waste of paper ( if you want to help save the environment then do n't buy this book ! ! ! ! )
military .... wait for it ...... i do n't care .
i guess wonders never cease .
the theology and philosophy are dumbed down and misrepresented to an embarrassing degree . nearly ever character who is meant to be clever simply interprets words literally .
and with a lot of outdated humor .
this plot was sooo predictable .
and by " okay " i mean , i did n't hate it , it was just okay .
digging out the information that is in it is tiring and frustrating .
no wonder her books are n't selling .
obviously , those books cover a lot more than just pay .
hungry for traditional zombie action , i was disappointed by the talking , weapon wielding , car driving undead that inhabit this book .
and it 's just downhill from there .
it did not keep my interest .
lastly , the ending left too many questions unanswered .
i have not finished it , keep going to something else .
so i hoped that this one would be good reading .
the girl needs to be rescued because how else are we going to get the plot somewhat moving ?
but i found the characters too boring and shallow to merit a novel .
too bad it 's told in way too many pages .
the author should have finished the book much sooner ... it became overwrought , boring and cliched .
the chapters were too long , the author ran on , and on without getting to the point .
i 'll save you the trouble and the money .
i saw there was a cookbook and was hoping for recipes to make the bites , but this ! ? !
but celebrity kids should be off limits .
the ending is one of the worst in history ! !
i do n't generally review books and do not claim to be an author or literary expert .
i just did n't care for her .
oh and guess what ?
the characters were blah .
( weird ) .
i found both books to be pretty boring .
i could nt get into this one .
it 's no crack .
( it feels like great chunks of this story are missing . )
i 'm more than halfway through this book and i do n't think i 'll continue any further .
maybe i should have read the blurb more carefully , but one 's hopes ca n't really be high for a book written by ex - models .
i was sadly disappointed with this book .
this book is not totally idiotic .
if she 's run dry on inspiration , then she should either end the series or wait til she can give us a decent product .
the glimpses they showed were boring but at least she was throwing us a bone .
no dye secrets were revealed that we not already in other dye books . i would not recommend this book to any one and regret buying it .
the title somehow attracts .... somehow it invites you to an intriguing story ..... but in the end it 's like a soap opera !
this aspect of the story is preposterous ( as well as just very poorly written .
the recipes seemed to be centered around mock meat .
the book is disappointing , but expected .
apart from its relentless lashing out at something greater , it is riddled with poor editing : redundancies , repetitions , irrelevancies , psychotic conclusions and plain old typos .
i 'm so disappointed , but that 's not to say not to try it .
i ca n't sympathize or relate to either .
i ca n't believe there 's an audience for this nonsense .
i find the images annoying to look at for any length of time .
i could n't understand it .
it is very disappointing when you get a book as bad as this .
i was not disappointed with the rich environment in which the story took place .
but in practice the book is so disorganized and jumps around so much it 's very hard to keep track of what 's going on .
the writing is poor and some of the concepts just lofty and not practical .
but please , let me go to the next chapter .
this is a very confusing book .
can you rip off the work of recent writers , mush them together into your own barely distinctive re - imagination and get published ?
the only interesting thing about him is that he appears to be a male chauvinist pig .
the hurried ending did n't match the slow pace of the book .
this book is about a woman who makes a terrible mistake , but is it such a bad mistake ?
she said , " i think they are like romance or something like that but a little racy . "
no need to buy it .
maybe he should have taken his own advice and focused more on authenticity than a passing fad .
again , i did n't finish the book .
i kept waiting for some redeeming quality to emerge , but by the time it did , it felt shallow and rushed .
where 's the big picture ?
however , as a novel , it fails miserably .
disappointing and a let down .
but most disappointing is the stilted dialogue which just does n't ring real .
i agree with most of the reviewers who did not care for this book .
i found myself skimming pages because nothing mattered and the dialogue was just dumb .
boring ... nothing new .
i got so bored with the story that i quit even reading the book .
story that drones on and on . if this is the author 's version of his autobiography , i am so very sorry .
this just does n't cut it .
there were too many balls in the air , and a few were dropped .
that is fine and good , but if i wanted to use my imagination quite that much , i would n't have bothered with reading a book .
i mean there was romance , but i definitely did n't feel anything about it as it was just kind of laid out there .
the ludicrous , really silly , conversations between a cat and a dog that take up several chapters .
i also thought the writing was poor at times and included too many non sequiturs that seemed out of place in a professional work .
this book was so painful to read .
i totally agree with some of the other reviews .
having trouble getting through this , it 's so bad .
* wanders off to find happiness *
listen to me : sexual innuendos does not make a book more adult .
it did not really hold my attention well , and i found myself skimming some parts .
a conspiracy !
unless you have no common sense and you 're less than an average intelligent person then buy this book but otherwise save your money for better books .
there 's no " sleepwalking " going on here .
perhaps he thinks this is charming . the author is not a great writer .
" folklore , " and " occultism . "
slow reading could n't get into story line .
i found myself skipping a lot of narration .
however , it tries to cover too much territory .
while i liked the imagery , i thought the plot was quite weak .
it provides anecdotes , but ultimately does not deliver the data .
the whole sinister someone is out to get her is ridiculous and predictable , the motives absurd . the ending is a real let down .
the beginning just made me angry because they felt like they coudn't fall for each other because they were not members of the " church " .
could not really get in to this book .
i 'm immortal and it 's horrible " idea has been done to death .
i do not vehemently hate it , nor did i absolutely despise it .
this , however , is the worst book i 've ever read !
i just did n't appreciate it , and it ruined the book for me .
sadly , this book did not live up to its hype for me .
a drug causes suicides in a certain genetic population .
if this is what was meant , this is incorrect .
very poor book .
the jumps in time threw me off and the overall plot just did n't grab me .
where has this updating taken place ?
i was determined to finish this book regardless of how boring and pretentious i thought it was .
but from an experienced journalist , this book is a complete and utter failure .
no real action or excitement .
i could barely plow through the entire book .
perhaps she could have done charity work or some other worthy endeavors to highlight a generous nature but it appears not .
it 's a boring novel .
you will not be missing much .
maybe a prologue could sum it up for me .
could n't get into it , did n't like the characters ...
if i could i would have rated it a " 0 "
i could n't get invested in the characters .
this book is one long , long , long droning monologue , recited by a not very interesting young girl / young woman .
very little happens for most of the book , in terms of plot or character development .
i guess i should stick with my romance novels !
the things they did were absolutely horrible .
if not , there is no use buying it .
it was all very cliched and there was no depth of character - they were like cardboard cut outs , and moving body parts .
the examples are poorly written and skip lots of essential steps .
i love this series but this was such a disappointment .
i could n't believe the praise it received compared to much better books of his .
dull , trite and very monotonous . the characters we 've become so attached to are gone .
blah blah .
save your money , and buy a book that actually teaches you something .
i looked forward with eager anticipation to this book for so long .
the fact that this is not the case should be evident by anybody who has ever taken the trouble to examine their own or anyone else 's lives .
she does n't think about anything or anyone outside of him .
her bias towards her subject is rather obvious .
much too complicated for me .
this book was the worst in the lot .
no jazz , just incessant noise .
that 's my guess however since i have no idea what the next story will be .
sure , i like she - hulk , but not really in a team book .
avoid this junk , which was banned for its dishonesty .
( giving it one star is far too generous .
her husband , on the other hand is very shallow .
it did n't take long , however , to realize that all of the charm of the preceding books is lost .
i did not find a point to this book at all .
this is either a format conversion gone bad or a serious case of poor or nonexistent proofreading .
when i read the description of this book i thought it had so much potential .
this is a very dull , repetitive treatise not worth the paper it was written on .
the characters were also named similar and it was too confusing
it really does n't sit well with me- just do n't bother with this one
it is not particularly well - written in terms of plausibility of plot , characters , or technical content .
it does n't apply to me either .
the plot was predictable ( in a bad way . )
i continued to skim in order to finish .
it does n't have a scrap of credibility , none .
do n't buy this book if you want fact finding from all perspectives .
i just wish he had spent more time there . i would n't recommend this book unless you 're really into conspiracy theories and the like .
i believe the tragedy is the purchase of an incomplete product .
books are not the same as soap operas .
maybe the writing was really great ( according to the good reviews here ) but the story itself , not so much .
i did not and would not purchase any product that was associated with the bible , even to laugh at it .
i even tried another book by the same author - no better .
this bore of a book is a huge disappointment to me .
the problem with the book , aside from the bias and incorrect facts , is the writing style .
this book could have been so much better but the plot was too slow and too simple .
this book is poorly written , and honestly is painful to read .
the main problem is that this book is boring .
i really expected more from this book , given the glowing reviews and preliminary character descriptions .
for someone who has n't read anything by this author , do n't start with this .
i totally disliked the characters - they were shallow , very poor character development by the author , and a totally unlikeable cast of characters .
this workbook is a detriment , not a positive addition , to anyone 's education . i had really high hopes for this workbook .
not only was it a struggle to finish this novel , i found the struggle of the characters overcoming their problems very depressing .
i found this book very hard to finish .
there is absolutely no insight into the victim .
his limp - wrist assessment of them would have been extremely insulting to them .
also , the book was too much about loving and kissing .
i do n't believe what the author says in this book .
ugh , what a waste of the time i spent reading it .
not worth the read , let alone the expense of buying it .
the plot may have been good , but i could n't get past the writing , punctuation , etc .
i , too , found the endless name - dropping endlessly irritating .
the identity of the serial killer is obvious about midway through the book and then after the identity is established we are led in a silly confrontation .
it seems the author just wanted to put all her ideas into this one book .
unfortunately and strangely , the author robs her own book of some suspense by giving away her villain early .
of course , a book would be pretty bland without any sort of figurative writing .
i also did n't care for the way he kept ' lifting ' her out of his car , and basically doing everything for her when he was with her .
i guess he 'll make a lot of money from the ignorant , though .
slow pacing , uninteresting characters ( for example , there 's an opera singer that all the men fall in love with -- why ?
the idea and basic story line for this book was a good one , but it is unfortunate the author had to make it so crude .
if she had any doubts , she should have said so . the author ends up in another relationship soon after her divorce .
it makes me wonder if these authors really have achieved enlightenment or is this another money making gimmick .
i have no idea why , except that i really didn&#8217;t like them - the gods .
but it 's very hard to find something positive to say about how this potentially wonderful story has taken a turn for the mediocre .
i kept hoping there was a story !
i finished reading the book because i was loyal to the author and to the story but was a total lackluster book .
the storyline seemed boring if not trite , and i did not find the writing style particularly interesting either .
but he lets his cynicism and narcissism get in the way at almost every turn .
if so , who was he and why do we hear nothing more of him ?
my advice would be to pass this one up .
a minor disappointment was the portrayal of apathetic police characters which , given the circumstances , was very hard to believe .
the metaphors are very juvenile and the dialogue , overall , is simple and unsophisticated .
it was disappointing to say the least . and last the most annoying , frustrating thing about the entire book was that the last few chapters were actually good .
aimed at younger readers , the book lacks sophistication .
i 'm usually a fast reader , but this was miserable !
this is a total snooze - fest .
i also failed to find the point at which stage i gave up .
in summary , " ignorance = strength " does not apply here .
life is too short to read literature this bad .
while under disguise the prince tells her how she could get the money for it .
on the whole , i had a negative impression of this book .
they were just poorly executed and read as though the book was rushed to print .
no time spent thinking about these subjects is wasted , but there are better guides than this one .
it just fell flat all around for me .
i did n't even get into it far enough to determine if it was a writing style issue for me or something else .
i 'm so glad i 'm not the only one that thought this one was such a snoozer and it sounds like the middle and end get no better .
i tried to like this book , but did n't manage to get very far into it . i think it 's her body movers series that everyone likes so much .
no mention of how to use author central on amazon.com , the place for author self - promotion .
some characters were underdeveloped to the point of nearly being obsolete .
there are good ideas here , but the author is too lazy to execute them .
there 's a big secret involving " the favor " she was asked to do .
frankly , this is something of a disappointment .
get the facts yourself and demonstrate the cognitive ability to form your own opinion instead of lazily relying on someone else who obviously has his own agenda in mind .
this book was selected by the host of my reading circle and i just could n't get into this book .
spreading filth and hatred . disgusting . sickening .
back to the last book , i ca n't get over how awful it was !
errata make the book unreadable ?
so , no , i did n't finish it .
the info that is helpful is pretty sparse and just in general i was expecting alot more .
moose , the small person , was , i suppose , thrown in for comic relief , but it was n't funny .
the cover blurb claims to be " the most compelling social history of beer ever written . "
is that so hard ?
it 's difficult to take a book seriously with statements like this : " the planet spins this way , right ?
so convoluted that i ended up not even caring who did it .
that 's not ok , but i can ... " when you lift the flap , you see an alternative to the inappropriate behavior .
i do not recommend this edition .
it is worse than adolescent .
but she was pretty much useless . of course with any battle there are deaths .
i found myself not caring what happened to meg , her grandmother or her daughter .
i really tried hard to read this book .
it is too much over the top .
the only reason i finished this book was because i was hoping she 'd meet some terrible fate and end up even more miserable .
not far past the preview i was sorry i purchased it , but finished it only because i was on vacation and needed something to read .
where and when got derailed ?
it 's just unreal . and then there is the ham radio communications .
complaining that a romance novel is clich&eacute ; is like whining because the beach is sandy .
i did not find interesting or intriguing characters .
he ignores the anti - competitive developments , e.g.
completely lost . without the awareness of our past , we sense no progress in life .
from the very beginning i found the writing simplistic and the story predictable .
it was a struggle to make it through this book but as it was a vine review i felt the need to read the entire thing .
maybe my own fault considering the title and what i should 've expected .
why half - ass things like this ?
do yourselves a break and save money on this tripe .
over used story theme .
having said that , i did want to be entertained , not annoyed .
interesting idea to begin with , but was bare bones by the ending ( no pun intended ) .
concisely put , this book is bad . very , very bad . it 's poorly written .
however , he becomes pinned to the ground , and then attempts to use his knife .
it was rather uninteresting , so much so , that i do n't even remember the plot .
please try ...
hard to follow , very slow beginning and did n't get much better
he fails too . the author seems to just loathe men .
what a ridiculous book !
i do n't read their other books on principle . i did n't like this book either .
there is no middle ground where the coin might be partially a dime and partially some other coin .
the story dragged .
please check this for me , as i do n't have it in my library at all .
yet i find none of that in this book in comparison with other books on the same subject .
was much too predictable .
sadly that is no longer the case .
i kept wondering if it would pick up , but it did n't .
that is the sole reason they desire her - to have sex with her .
how is that for self - serving ? ! ?
then it became really boring for my taste .
i usually try to struggle thru a book but i just could n't do it with this one .
while the majority of this story was fairly decent , it fell apart at the ending .
sorry not to my taste at all .
i found both the main character and the sister extremely irritating .
it is disappointing to read a novella by a man who surely can write , but who fails to use his skills as a writer or a story teller .
the romantic line in the story was contrived .
they have failed .
the basic underlying ideas of the author seems to be that left - wingers worry about something that is not really a problem .
once again , i understand why this book was written , but i feel it 's way too preachy .
since other reviewers covered the synopsis , i 'll just give my quick thoughts on this : characters : terribly written .
and not much else , unfortunately .
for some reason though , this book did not sit well with me at all . what bothered me most was that many parts of the plot seemed entirely unrealistic .
as another reviewer remarked , the similes are endless and , although they might sound good , for the most part are simply off target .
pick one of them , just not this one .
when you no longer like the " hero " , it 's hard to like the book .
it was very annoying and you wanted to just smack her at times ! !
the book is riddled with technical errors , some of which have a direct impact on the plot .
i was really sad to give this book such a low rating .
yes , i know the character is excited , i do n't need " ! "
instead , for the most part , i slogged through the book like an assigned college text .
while the writing was good the story did n't capture me at all .
i found the book went into too much detail that did n't seem to add to the story as a whole .
there was n't a character in it for whom i felt any affection , either , although a lot of them would be exceedingly hard to live with .
it was a commercial for previous books and a short story with a lousy ending .
and there was absolutely no excitement whatsoever .
flipping back and forth between the sub plots was ok , but they did n't cohere very well .
not at all well written , and disappointing because of that .
it was too graphic and of such a horrible crime !
this book is the absolute biggest joke of a wrestling book ever written .
i 'm sorry to say this but this book was not good .
not quite so flattering , to say the least .
however , the child was entirely ill - equipped to deal with the true nature of the world . it 's not going to be okay .
therefore it misses out on the best part of feminism .
and by garbage i 'm not referring to the sex scenes which are about as exciting as watching paint dry .
his sophomoric approach is suitable to convince uncritical readers at a high school level .
i could n't tell who was who .
not exactly sorry i read it , but .... hmmmm ... well , maybe i am .
) , flies somewhere ? ?
i do n't think i would bother to read any other books by this author .
the rest of the book is basically a race against time to get the people on the top floors out .
and he does n't cite anything .
i wo n't give anything away , but please read , then tell me i 'm wrong .
no one should rely on it for any purpose .
really - why waste money on it ?
there 's a lot of sex , but i found myself skimming those scenes .
it got to be very heavy going and i skipped over parts ( sorry . )
it 's gimmicky , self - absorbed , repetitive , and lacking in plot .
it 's the characters that made it unenjoyable .
this book was assigned to us for premarital counseling and it is incredibly poor by god 's standard .
maybe she had a contract to deliver and just ran out of time .. who knows .
this book was a little too graphic and the main characters were a little unbelievable .
why would that happen , or why would someone offer to have their truck searched then - one or the other does not add up ?
i did n't get much of that info , but i did get quite a bit of hero worship and fluff .
it bored me and i skipped from the begining to the end and got the full sense of the story .
this is a bad book it is a big waste of time and do n't waste your money bad bad book
it was so boring i was unable to finish it . it 's obvious that the authors did n't put much effort into the book .
the only reason i finished it is because i wasted money buying it and to not finish it would have meant an even bigger waste of money ! !
however , my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the cd - rom .
very hard to keep up with the people .
the author presents a simple formula .
jesus specifically mentions that giving is meaningless unless it comes from the heart .
in spite of the lack of editing , i felt compelled to read it .
these books are just awful .
by then she had almost killed off both of her main characters and most readers could tell that she was tired of writing about these people .
i am having trouble imagining how an editor let this through .
had a hard time keeping track of the characters , and finally realized that i just did n't care about any of them .
the low rating is due more to what i was expecting rather than this being a bad book .
if the author does n't spend some time making the characters real , i am left unhappy .
depressing , and gratuitous .
this story just seemed pretty obvious to me .
what happens next is predictable and totally canned .
the characters are so poorly drawn that one would have to wonder if it was intentional .
just a silly girlfriend kind of final scene that sucked .
i keep hoping this series is going to get better but again , i 'm disappointed .
i really wanted it to be .
they either died too quickly before anything really big started , or they just fell .
i found the constant use of - or reference to - her title of " princess " ( self - proclaimed ) to be annoying .
( and please - bubba ?
i am sorry , but if one is going to write a mystery and have it be somewhat believed , one has to account for events that do not seem plausible .
i could only make it halfway through before i just had to quit it .
it seemed like she tried so hard to be out of the box that she ended up being a wishy washy and unfaithful person .
do they condemn products not advertised ?
am i missing pages , or was it just never resolved ?
very small book , few pages and few stickers .
quite the ego .
there is little science , scholarship or , critical analysis .
i so wanted to like this book but it was just all over the place .
why ca n't a writer use experienced female characters .
it is built on a rather weak plot with some parts rather unbelievable .
if these extraneous items were omitted , how much of the novel would be left ?
this is supposedly a " professional " quality book .
i kept waiting for the story to improve , hoping for the story to improve .
i have waited for this book to come out , and i am thrilled and disappointed .
it had a lot of type errors .
finished , and completely unsatisfied .
this turned out to be a boring book which the author filled with photographs of rooms reflecting surprisingly similar decorating approaches .
totally unlikeable characters and shallow story .
get the " dead tree " version .
derivative and slightly dull .
i was n't really sure what to expect when i picked up this book but i certainly did n't expect what i read .
this book does not fill the bill either . part i reads like a dissertation and is really boring , filled with examples of the origin of gossip in ancient times .
but , to me , it was too little too late . i like the idea of this book .
not professional at all .
sometimes entire paragraphs are repeated almost verbatim only pages apart .
and i can not recommend that anybody else buy any of them either .
bottom line , i did n't gain much from it .
she has to feed it by having sex ?
i do n't like incomplete stories at any price .
the teeny amount of drama is nearly entirely the " but i thought he / she thought " type and is pretty tedious .
this is not a cure !
there were some flashes of insight and amusing writing , but it could have been condensed into a short story .
he introduces an entity called the professor , who must be one of the most boring and unbelievable characters in recent fiction .
there should have been more to this book .
do n't bother saving them !
the dialogue was stale and there was lots of telling , rather than showing .
he does , in fact , elude to a system but only talks about it ever in the most vague manner with no details , certainly nothing useful .
i have searched the internet and found nothing .
but the panel is flooded with verbose dialogue leaning into becoming a reading chore .
it 's been down hill for me since then .
but its not without revelations .
this may or may not be a good thing depending on your taste .
it just got boring .
it is not funny and really just not good .
i also found some of the story logic questionable .
if this is not a recipe for disaster , then what is it ?
ismae is a weak and wavering character and she is supposed to be an assasin .
they were not the same person . this is not a small and unknown detail of this time period so it 's a pretty obvious error .
avoid this nonsense and just live in the present and do n't dwell on the past .
that does n't fit with a spoiled child .
the tone of the book is like a little punk kid wrote it .
this book is way too long for what it is .
the bad news , of course , is that it is utterly derivative and simplistic .
the question of in which businesses you should compete assuming they are not changing .
the heroine is awful , she thinks she 's beautiful and worries a lot about fashion , even when people around her are dying .
i read this book with the intention of really trying to listen to what concerns conservatives have about liberals , but i was ultimately dissapointed about the content .
if the author was n't going to expand on that aspect , it should have never been brought up . i found the ending predictable .
if i had to use one word to describe it : vague .
i have mixed feeling about this book .
you feel dreadfully stuck in the mind of an autistic person and for that i respect it greatly .
as others have already mentioned , the book 's title is a piece of misleading hype .
this is not what i was hoping it would be .
will not finish it .
this book is a compete rip of !
the plot seemed a bit dated .
it really did n't have me turning pages and i thought it was quite boring .
she did n't wallow in self - pity .
i felt like " ok , ok i get it already .
but i feel our money could be better spent on educating our daughter about -- well anything .
but this book was absolutely awful .
i was hoping for something better from the author after reading the beginning her serial , but it was n't here .
same plot just changed the names .
my resolve did not last long . i really tried to push through this books so hard before seeing the movie .
i found no rhyme or reason to anything in this book .
such a bummer .
i hope not . [ ... ]
some scenes mount toward a climax , and then just fall flat .
there 's really not that much different in this book than any of the others in the series .
i actually threw the book in the recycle bin .
but this is not intuitive , just like quantum physics ( do you realize how weird quantum entanglement seems ? )
a let down of a finale .
in a word : shallow .
i 'd go into more detail but i refuse to do spoilers .
this book was bound poorly and impossible to use in such a format .
this was simply bizarre .
i found it so incredibly vulgar that i just could n't keep going .
however i could n't get it to load on my kindle in a format that would read .
the author tries to pass herself off as an expert , yet a lot of what she wrote ca n't be verified .
i lost interest after that . the set - up may interest some .
i did not find it the work of a mature writer unless he was deliberately " marketing " to a teenage male audience .
i just became disinterested and could not make myself read until the end .
she was a serious pushover and had way too many insecurities .
where was the ending to the plot ?
it didn't . don't waste your time with this unsatisfying book .
why does this book make no sense ? )
just an other annoying omission .
it left me lost , in every sense of that word .
i just could not get through the last few chapters , and i almost always finish books .
this book like some others referenced in reviews is headed for the trash bin .
there was nothing subtle about this book .
however , once i actually cracked open this book , i found it was nothing like i was hoping for .
i need not go into the ridiculous amount of toys , t - shirts , posters , video games , etc .
this book was nothing but duplication of what i already knew or am learning from other sources .
this one just tries to explain why everything is the way it is without having a really interesting plot .
worse , he argues that in principle " every religion preaches the truth of propositions for which no evidence is even conceivable , " which is ridiculous .
the only problem with that latter point is that , if one were to do a little research , this assertion of journalistic integrity is put into serious question .
the book has no depth .
it 's a scam for the publisher to charge this type of prize .
i could not follow the story .
the point is , why was any of this malicious gossip necessary ?
and as with other books that have made this claim , it falls short ... way short .
blah blah blah . the main thing i have against this book is that it is clearly unclear .
why was the book bad ?
i 've ordered the same book from a different publisher , as i really want to read it again without all the printing errors .
there were n't any of them that i 'd want to spend time with -- each more selfish and short sighted than the last .
if it had , i 'd been okay with it .
( sorry could n't resist .
it was going from bad to worse and then i read a review and realized this was not for me .
this is no joke - the book reads as if written by a severely depressed person .
the heroine was more worried about her money to the point of ridiculousness , and the hero was very immature , not at all the romance reader 's usual expectation .
thus , for them to publish this book is not surprising in the least .
but , this was so bad .
the action was lacking here , especially considering characters involved .
no amount of love can redeem a jerk who treats women like dirt .
it stoned me into boredom .
if she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense - maybe ?
this is not a book i vehemently disliked , but a book that really never served any purpose to me .
not much , but still .
this was not true at all !
it has no redeeming values at all and is n't likely to appeal to anyone , not even fans of trashy books .
but it has too many quotes , too many contradictions , ...
it is almost as if she does n't like them anymore .
i do n't think i 've ever read a book that had so many broken , incomplete , partial , rambling , and impossible to follow sentences .
i wanted so badly for this to be a good romance ... but it was n't .
fair story , tho char .
i 'm sure there are many people who like to read nothing but sex but i 'm not one of them .
however , the addition of the flashbacks / nightmares the hero had just did n't flow well with the story .
not hideous , but not very good , either .
storylines were ridiculous and unrealistic .
for some reason , could not get into this book .
the rest of the downloads are previews of his other books .
beyond that , it&#8217;s impossible to tell what material presented in quote marks was actually spoken by someone or simply invented .
i looked forward to this book , and i am disappointed .
unless you are a fan of s&m ; i do not suggest you purchase this book .
in some areas , it is just stupid .
very disappointing and headed to the goodwill box .
but i ca n't get into it .
that seems designed more to avoid lawsuits than to teach geography !
seriously , it was bad enough that i just skimmed the rest of the book afterwards .
unfortunately , though , i have to agree that this book was such a disappointment !
i do n't usually write reviews of books , but this one was so disappointing that i felt compelled .
however even in the realm of romance novels there is such a thing as going too far .
the raging sex encompassed the whole book to the point i thought i was going into heat reading this thing .
the main characters are all very shallow and predictable , and the lead himself is somewhat of a simpleton , which makes his development even less interesting .
that 's ok , if it 's coupled with some funny self - reflection ... but that seemed to be missing .
save your money and be happy this book is only available used and is currently out of print .
then there are the major inconsistencies .
i did feel that the book is well researched but try as i might i just could n't connect with the story .
very dissapointing !
but , why do it at all ?
it is not my normal genre so it could just be that .
i finished it because i had to see how these characters were possibly going to untangle themselves out of the mess they 'd made , but i was left thoroughly unsatisfied .
the only suggestion that i agree with here is to get a secured card , preferably where you bank already .
it 's alluded to but never really explored . basically a waste of time .
and since it was supposed to take place in the present , the occurances were too unrealistic .
but i made it to the end ( albeit with some skimming ) .
it 's definitely not worth the purchase .
this book is a snide , underwhelming expression of nothing .
in fact i 'm begining to wonder why i have a kindle at all if i ca n't get the books i want on it .
stupid story , cardboard characters and " instant " love that was totally unbelievable .
people may want to call it complex , but it really is n't .
nothing like this happened .
not men looking for power or anything like that !
this book is a rip - off like his others , i 've seen it in my border 's .
the writing is convoluted , the author is wallowing in his self - loathing , and with no apparent goal in mind .
many times i felt hit over the head with too - obvious points .
there 's almost no description of climbing here .
i mean ... if he hated it so much , why not leave ?
and the end left what happened to the check unclear .
this was to get rid of all the spam .
some books , in my opinion , are just plain overrated .
this book dragged do bad i did n't even want to finish .
instead , it seems like a subplot to their run from the police .
if you do n't have it , please do n't bother with this one .
it 's a political manifesto , nothing more .
i just hate when i read a book i do n't like .
" " no , it is not too late ! "
i really do n't like her voice .
i tend not to skim over lines , but found myself doing so , without missing the plot at all .
i personally did n't like the ending .
it was so terrible .
instead , he wandered all over , inserting a lot of unnecessary detail .
too bad it is spoiled by the ending .
this is supposed to be an action series of novels .
good writing , but depressing subject .
average girl with oblivious parents becomes the object of obsession of a paranormal boy .
it was a bit confusing , which did not help .
not recommended for any age or gender .
i think this book should have been just a magazine article .
i quit reading this book because it was so depressing .
but it was just blah blah blah .
i saw ellroy on the o'reilly factor so i gave the book a try .
the " jokes " are not funny .
it was shockingly uninteresting .
in my opinion a few good sex scenes filled with romances does it better than a whole bunch of cold sex scenes .
not enough to really feel for them .
i thought there were some interesting parts , but overall is was just boring .
why does n't she just escape ?
he denies satan 's direct involvement in the fall of man .
as far as i could tell , there was no real plot .
do they have any idea of how uneducated that sounds ?
i understood the stories are rather mechanical and not interesting .
why read the same book over again ?
the big scene at the end lacked emotion , which is my biggest disappointment .
seriously waste of cash , unbelievable that nora did this .
it was slow and jumble .
most of the book is devoted to long , boring examinations of quantum physics .
i do nt think i will bother reading anything else she wrote as she just did nt engage me whatsoever .
boring book and a waste of my time so nobody else here read it .
male ?
fell asleep reading it and was not even tired .. now that s how bad it is .
events are way to rushed .
it is nothing but one long court transcript .
i guess if you enjoy that kind of stuff , you might enjoy it , but i would rather have more plot and substance to the books i read .
this is pure mummy porn .
i 'm sorry but i did n't achieve the goal for my cartoon with this book .
the action sequences ( when there were any ) were terrible .
its just dark for the sake of being dark .
unfortunately , this book was boring .
it states that there is n't research to back up its superiority as an approach ... that 's not true ... and that it 's " time consuming " .
this book is not particularly well written , and it is very slow .
outside of that ... boring ! !
but no such imagination is on display here .
the idea is good in concept , but the book is tiny and not really worth it .
it became extremely annoying to see her be so immature and wimpy .
i can not say . don't believe the hype .
this is the part over which i got excited the most and the part that disappointed me the most at the same time .
i just wanted more from it and more actual love and not obsession and mental illness .
it appears this woman has no common sense at all .
it is definitely not a guide to the trail which it does not claim to be .
it really is that bad , and apparently it does n't get better , despite some flashes of potential here and there .
even though i appreciate the author 's attempt to lighten up the story , i wish she would 've left it a dismal ending like i assumed it would have .
i guess they decided it would make a good whore house .
for me , the erotica just was n't there .
as the plot starts up with what could have been a twist the story is over .
but although the books starts well enough , it lacks a story .
i never felt so bored before with the others .
i just think this plot was awkward and thus forced her to write a twisty convoluted mess in order to make it somehow work .
this book was just too basic for me , i do nt feel it was written very well at all .
this is obnoxious .
boring travel .
i sort of scanned the book after the wedding .
unfortunately this college student along with his friend who shows up are too stupid to live .
a lot of his dialogue is downright laughable .
although there were a few parts of the book that were particularly well - written ... overall , it was somewhat of a disappointing read .
very predictable story .
it didn't . this is a most definitely not a " legal thriller . "
there are too many books waiting to be read to have to " work to get thru " , maybe sometime i 'll try to finish , but not anytime soon .
the revision mirrors the original and was simply cut down in size .
i mean , is this any way to run a country ?
the story had a slow start , it was hard to follow the author 's train of thought ; i kept reading for a while longer but it did n't improve .
i expect most people who purchase this will be disappointed .
i found the repetition annoying . equally annoying is her constant patter about god .
it 's dark and violent - there 's very little that is positive or cheerful or happy to be found here .
it looks like the information is here , but i found his style of explanation to be dreadful .
she 's a whiner .
the pace of the story is rather slow , it picks up enough in the middle to keep me reading , but overall i was just not impressed .
this book is not for the serious reader .
i found the passion unexciting and unwarranted .
i found this book dull . again , this is not the type of book i typically read , so it had little chance to score well with me .
no dialogue , no plot and no suspense .
clich&eacute;s abound .
i was n't sure about this story as it had so many mixed reviews .
very hard to get into , and hard to stick with it . i am an aspiring romance writer and bought this book to help me write the love scenes .
you would be wise to avoid anything with this man 's name on the cover .
it was like he got tired of writing and just hurried up and sent it to the publishers .
i like that he was n't an arse .
more money for the author , more books for everyone - seems like a win win .
but do n't bother with this trade .
i found it to be more like a rant from someone who really does not have a clue how hard life can be .
i was disappointed with this book for several reasons .
he was a rapist , sadistic abuser , a cheater , overly promiscuous , a vile murderer and a very unsavory character .
nothing bad about this book .
this seems like more like a book more about " atmosphere " than plot .. an atmosphere of suspicion , of shadowy figures behind the scenes pulling the strings of events .
the mother offers herself to the hero and he accepts her offer of having sex .
i just could n't see the falling - in - love part .
quite frankly i found it immature , trashy , and a total waste of paper and ink .
the last chapters or so were rushed , but it was the abrupt ending that absolutely ruined the entire series for me .
it was not what i expected and lost interest very quickly .
but i stuck it out , cause they were supposed to be soooo good .
instead , he wrote some kind of bastard crap - fiction / neuroscience nonsense .
i could n't find a story ... he seemed to wander all over the place with fillers .
i do n't think that word means what he thinks it means .
do n't change it or speed it up .
! horrible horrible book !
the repetitive words and writing are so annoying .
i thought it sounded interesting .
but too few and far between .
he wrote this book because he wanted money .
i suppose that 's nice and all , for a newlywed , but i wanted a good story , too , and all the " romance " got in the way .
is this like a jewish propaganda or something ? ?
overall it did not seem to be well thought out or developed .
to rub salt into the wounds , the end of the trilogy is basically a deus ex machina of the poorest sort .
the characters remain supremely uninteresting and there are still no original ideas .
maybe i 'll return this one for a refund .
will not read anything else by this author and would not recommend this book to anyone else .
( i can barely believe i picked it back up at all !
but " who ? "
felt if the book wants to be taken seriously , it should be edited seriously .
this is n't to say anyone who reads the book would be but i was .
but in the professor 's telling of them in this book , they come across as so much belaboring the obvious .
even in juvenile fiction , disrespect and/or rebellion toward authority seems the norm .
pendergast has just gotten to the point that i can no longer suspend my disbelief .
he was moody and cruel for little - to - no reason , and walked around with a rather large chip on his shoulder .
this was a huge disappointment .
i must say i was disappointed .
other then that , do n't bother .
i certainly would n't describe this book as a " breezy read " .
i think there is a reason no one is reviewing it or her new book , because they stink , no one likes them and is buying them .
when he 's up in heaven he asks god , ' what happened , i thought you would save me ' ?
nothing to do with the mystery and b.
to make it worse the character 's reaction to the violence was hokey and unbelievable to the point of being irritating .
not cool - even from a snarky guy .
but the other end of the spectrum is n't very appealing , either .
" but after that , there is nothing but a kind of random regurgitation of previously published work .
his plot twists felt contrived .
it 's just not a mash - up that works here .
if you are a subject matter expert i must wonder why not use something better ?
you can flip thru the pages by part of the country , but it is tedious and not as easy as it could be .
not a bad light read .
what i found was insulting and frankly not very scientific . the author 's conclusions ?
i give the author credit for being creative , but his story certainly did n't enhance my relationship with god .
the book unnecessarily raises a false alarm .
this is really hard for me to write .
the beginning of the book was good but the ending was the worst part of this book .
i 'm not baffled that the story got published .
this is a most disappointing volume .
the book was fairly well written the characters interesting but the end was horrible .
there are few military books that i do not finish .
i felt he was trying to create rather than use his influence .
and , yes , it is a good idea to eat nutritious foods and take vitamins while you 're pregnant . however ...
it pretty much was about this book .
it 's every bit as bad as the worst review here says it is .
this one should be relegated to the waste bin of history .
if you had n't read the book , then i suggest you avoid this review , as it may contain important plot points .
after finishing the other book i returned and made myself finish . not really worth the time or money .
the scene is bland and emotionless , pointless , adding nothing to the book .
the story line is so slow and filled with useless words .
why ? ! ! !
the wild jumps in logic were atrociously bad that they tainted everything she had to say .
please for the love of god save your money and buy something else !
this is a disappointment coming from one of my favorite pop authors .
in short , this is a very disappointing book .
cliche , cliche , cliche !
i feel like this book is n't about anything but sex .
it 's not that i do n't think she is ignorant and moody .
the author kept self - promoting himself and the content was stale , pathetic , and told anyone who is n't living in constant fear that they are deniers .
if the update fixes the problems then i 'd consider updating my review accordingly , but for now , i 'm unimpressed .
sorry to say - these were not .
but it gets derailed in many places --- do we really need a lengthy description of how difficult it was to hook up her internet ?
this book is either horribly written or protestantism just has a really weak foundation .
and what did they have in common that made them think marriage was a good idea ?
you may be able to figure it out based on the rules from the diet book , but then why do you need this book ?
usually i do not let a book cover dictate whether i read a book or not but in this case i could not help it .
the author says that if you do n't get it , then you simply are not ready to get it .
i did n't like them ; therefore there was no hope of liking the book .
i found this book by reading through the reviews and most of them suggested that this book was promising .
there was a plot with the father that really seemed to drag along .
it 's predictable and only vaguely interesting .
are n't we animals , too ?
i did slog through the entire book , but never got interested in what would happen next , nor did i much care what happened to the characters ....
in terms of objectivity , this book has little to offer .
it was hard to follow - and when revelation is hard to follow , and the commentary commenting on revelation is tough to follow then we are struggling .
the " towering ? "
i think he 's kills off too many of the main character 's friends and allies too .
boring ; very , very boring .
instead the book is filled with little inside knowledge .
as stated , i have a strange affinity for this series despite the less than stellar writing and recurring mediocrity .
way too many " formulas " for mathematicians .
she even finds a stray dog and there is too much nonsense spent talking about naming the dog , etc .
the story was poorly constructed with a number of loose ends and plot devices that made little sense .
i glimpsed through the book , but the writing was the same .
a mix with undeveloped characters combined with poor writing skills make it a really hard book to finish .
unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth ( not that i know of ) .
it 's jarring , and these bits do n't actually add anything particularly important . the whodunnit itself is middling .
not for me but i like to finish what i start .
these have got to be the most tedious men to ever headline a superhero comic .
however the storyline felt too simple - it could have been any character , in any setting , making the exact same motions .
i 'll just use some old characters and write very similar but minuscule differences for them .
" save your money , save your time .
nope . it seemed like the author was taunting the reader .
try this : define a method for distinguishing between " material " and " non - material " causes .
as science fiction it is terribly derivative and superficial .
she is probably a good doctor but her writing skills need much honing .
the whole war thing was n't .
no amount of suspension of disbelief seemed to help me with this book either .
the biggest problem i had was really basic .
it is so short in length that it does not justify the price in any way .
it 's a shame that book meant to be as comprehensive as this did not have better editing .
this book is not more than this particular author working out his own frustrations on paper with a lack of understanding of the truth .
i was hoping it would get better and have some thing good in it and some kind of a message or something .
blogs or articles seem a better medium for those peculiar bits , in my opinion .
there was absolutely no flow and most of the book was the author " telling " us what was happening and not " showing " .
there was a decent plot that i felt was n't explored well enough .
i just wanted to get this book done .
when he was n't my mind started to wander .
i just about stopped listening to this book because it was so unrealistic .
readers with a history of sexual abuse should be forewarned , some of this can be very difficult to endure .
either i 'm getting too old for him or he 's losing his touch .
! i would not recommend this novel .
the demographic information is laid out ok , but it 's constantly scattered with suppositions and political opinions !
in fact , i could not have cared less what happened to him .
a friend loaned me this book , so i figured ' why not .
other times i was just shaking my head , saying " no way , no way ! " .
the characters spend a lot of time talking and very little time doing anything .
in my opinion it is too difficult to understand in many areas to hold the interest of the average reader .
but do n't read this !
uh ... that 's your subconscious , not a ghost ) .
as it is , these characters are almost caricatures - funny exaggerations caught up in a story that is just too bizarre .
it 's decent enough , but the series on a whole is getting an extreme " paint - by - numbers " feel to it .
i could not even get through it because each story was more horrendous then the next .
i 'm not entirely sure what i was expecting from this book , but an earnest - yet - sometimes - misguided series of advice essays was n't it .
if you can not afford the high price , check table of contents and get the articles elsewhere ( if you can ) .
to tell the truth , the writing was barely above fan sci - fi in some places . the characterization is also , most unfortunately , pretty bad .
no matter -- much of the rest of the book is spent using examples to argue for the existence of such people .
the characters are so shallow and vague , there is no possible way to make a connection to them .
boring , took too long to get any action going .
i ca n't accept this is what " chick lit " is supposed to be - it is more like pre - teen .
this is nothing more than a small print modern translation for reading .
i will not purchase this author again .
the main character was ditzy and took crazy risks to try and clear her boyfriend 's name ( who she had found out was married ) .
she would bear watching . my stomach was quite shamelessly reminding me that it was feeling rather hungry .
this book with its turgid and slow writing was not unfortunately , the worst end of the world book i 've read , but it rates very high on that chart .
the main character tried to be witty , and savvy , and somewhat fell flat nonetheless .
stock characters , predictable plot , and no surprise ending , violence , and an annoying narration between the main character and himself !
i could not believe how many times the same facts were mentioned , which made reading terribly boring .
in other words , active policing of the reviews . why do i care ?
sorry ...... this book was a waste of time .......
" say what ? ? ?
normally , i do not like to a ) write negative reviews and b ) return books that i buy .
many seem trite and overly straight - forward ; the worst read like something from a health magazine .
there is the smallest seed of a possible thriller here , but the author chose to fill the story with unnecessary details and useless information .
however , over the course of the book , nothing ... really .... happened .
seemed like a basic cookbook for the novice cook .
i did finish the book but it was a struggle .
it jumped around too much and left me confused at times . the author also repeated himself at times .
that sounds foolish .
with almost reckless abandon he tosses off a few references to support his idea .
the inexplicable dashing round , the improbable plot points and even the non - ending all make more sense when thought of as a tv episode .
or think about it .
i know i 'm harping , but i ca n't recall a worse case of this .
there 's nothing to like about the main character .
the truth is , that i was sadly dragged into an excrutiatingly slow book which quickly launched into it 's thinly disguised diatribe on feminism and the sexist treatment of women .
overall , though interested in the topic , i found the book rather disappointing both in content and readability .
but our author said that no state is ever reached from an infinite past !
i wanted more meat and less filler ...... but ......... i should probably not complain and try writing a book myself .
it really had the makings to be a good book but it was laced with too many unrealistic events .
then the book just spiraled into unbelievability .
or speculations .
swearing language : none that i recall .
i cross referenced this translation with others and stopped using it .
this woman is a disgrace .
on finishing the sample i was convinced not to buy the book .
it was not worth the price of the book nor the time it took to read it .
or maybe we can be manipulated to just feel sorry for our " sick " president .
it 's a mediocre romance , dressed up in fancy language , and without much convincing romance to be found , either .
i was hoping for something less cliche and more gripping .
there 's a lot to like in this book , which makes it difficult to describe why exactly it did n't work for me .
this book had an underlying depressing tone that left me cold .
terrible , terrible , terrible .
she does this throughout the book and it is annoying .
i only finished it because it would annoy me not to .
the premise of the book -- disinformation in the information age -- is promising .
very angry writing .
but ... money ?
the writing is ordinary and prosaic , the dialogue is a bit flat and uninspiring and the characters are rather uninteresting and unconvincingly developed .
i mean it just really did n't float my boat but if ur into the whole back n forth then this book may be for u.
do n't waste time with the glossary in the back of the book .
several reviewers have already done an excellent job of stating the many , many flaws with this book . the only thing i can add is it 's just plain awful .
this one was just too disturbing and not in a fun way .
i came across this book in the library and thought i 'd give it a try -- i should have know better .
luckily i did n't buy this one , i checked it out at the library .
to me this book seemed fanciful , poorly researched , and poorly written .
as to women accumulating sexual experiences because it 's considered prestigious , that does n't happen either .
the author states that there will be no need for marriage which i do agree with since marriage seems to serve the purpose of bearing children .
i do n't want to read her story- so i skip to the end .
the other thing that bothered me was that there was nothing to give me a clue as to which period this book was set in .
the writing style is just not for me .
terrible , disappointing and too easy to put down .
hated the ending ( there was none ) .
many people like this book , so i decided to give it a try . i did n't even finish it .
and i did n't find much actual information on the way she shoots - not enough for me , anyway .
the dialog was like cardboard cutouts speaking .
save yourself some time and skip this .
* this book was given to me by the publisher in return for my honest review .
it lacked direction , and ultimately a point .
' " not recommended - save your money .
the plot is slow moving to the point of tedium .
i did n't care too much for the ending in this book . the movie makes me cry .
there are plenty of readers that are looking for this book , but not me .
they do not add to the plot in a meaningful way ( perhaps because the plot is so lousy ? )
could have been a great book but i ca n't get past the awkward writing and slow pace .
our heroine behaves quite bizarrely for woman trying to find her supposedly loved husband and you quite often have to scratch your head as to why she acts as she does .
its so bad that your reading and you do n't even remember what you read in the previous chapters because your so bored .
i tried to like this character , with all her flaws , but i just could n't .
this novel is the same .
this book was hard to finish and hard to understand why it was written .
bad
he 's not the only one looking for her .
i was a bit aggravated when i suspected where the story was headed and skipped ahead to confirm my suspicions which is something i rarely do .
very disjointed , lots of detail left out .
alas repeating the same phrases verbatim throughout the book was annoying and detracted from the fascinating biographies .
really did not hold my interest at all .
well there 's a very good reason it 's not been done before ; it 's just ridiculous and does n't work .
she did n't even seem to like anyone else either .
i found it hard to follow and could not determine what the point was .
in my opinion time ill spent .
very disappointing novel -- beware of all the positive reviews here !
just why do smart people do stupid things ?
too expensive
the idea behind the book is nothing new -- a collection of funny , not - so - funny , awkward , " eh ?
instead , the book ends up being annoyingly shallow and too hastily written . we have a family who seems to know nothing but happiness .
how could no one see this little girl out in the world and not say something ?
do n't get this if you have nothing better to do than get a headache and get pissed off .
actually , i flat out hated that aspect . and the end was a horrible disappointment .
why am i going on and on about unintentional messages in works of children 's fiction in preface to talking about this book ?
she seemed to be a composite of every pitiful female character the author could dream up .
absolutely no resolution to the problem -- leaving the reader hanging .
rumi is excruciatingly awkward , to the point that it is almost uncomfortable to read about some of her exploits .
i was a few pages in and became frustrated because i thought the writing was kind of contrived .
i like novels that are intended to be fun and a little silly .
having it take place in the future was just a plain bad idea .
mainly the detailed cooking and food prep explanations made the book drag .
now , it comes across forced and almost unreadable .
you could tell where the interesting quotes would have gone .
this book is just another attempt at fame and recognition ... the purposeful title says it all .
it got so bad i did n't even want to finish the book but i continued in hopes that the author would redeem herself .
it seems there really was n't much to the story except for them fighting or having sex which was basically all the relationship was based on .
not one that really did grip and it is hard to explain why .
it was like the author was lashing out at the audience ; it felt like the book was a ploy for hope and just ripped all faith apart .
if you like noir , this may be for you but it was just not the book for me .
do nt bother with this book .
a well - written book in some ways , with lots of humorous asides by the author , but ultimately , the book is very lacking in substance .
every instance of recounted " history " is still blurred with too much conjecture to make any sort of a conclusion .
absolutely none of the characters are likeable .
what he is trying to do is to be fair and give both sides of the story but the book is so poorly presented that it frustrates more then enlightens .
i expected there was more to her story than that , but there was n't .
this caricature of obnoxious atheists would be offensive if it were n't so implausible .
but i did not have that moment .
this is not a reference work for beginners .
long , repetitive , boring .
i am afraid this book is a complete waste of time .
there is good advice - very basic - here , but not worth the price of admission .
but such stuff never came .
anyway , i was real disappointed .
it didn&#8217;t work for me so i wouldn&#8217;t be too eager to recommend this book .
it seemed that this book was intended to be longer and was cut short and wrapped up early for some reason .
as for the quality and content of the book , it was vastly overpriced .
it was dumb and annoying . this book was also way too long .
could it be it was more of the co - author 's writing than his ?
for him , it 's about the guy , not the thinking .
there was nothing in this anyone would want .
i do n't see what chapter 8 has to do with saving money - really , " building heritage " saves grocery money ?
but the constant repetition is very annoying after a while .
nothing new in this book for any serious bear fan .
i admire the author 's intention but the result is an unfortunate mish - mash .
long or short , his books ai n't for me .
it is too long and drags in many places .
there was no sizzle , not even a spark .
then another character says , " then please do so " .
not according to my math .
i was hoping that if i stuck with it , it might eventually have something to say worth hearing .
this could have been very entertaining story but the author wasted page after page explaining why each character felt the way they did .
i had to force myself to read this novel to the end because i hate to start a book and not finish it .
even with better editing this would n't be one of my favorite books , but i would n't have felt like i was trudging though sludge trying to get through it .
it would make a great deal more sense to simply realize that ancient scripture was written by fallible men trying to explain what they felt was totally unexplainable .
it 's like writing a book on the cure for cancer , but never actually giving out the formula for the drug .
i dunno , just seems weird .
the story to me is just okay .
he wrote a book report on it and stated that he did not like the book in his report .
her romance stories are very typical , & it 's not hard to figure out the story line .
this book is thin to the point of looking anemic .
need to start wrapping up other story lines instead of adding new ones and literally nothing happening
but noone seems interested in how the particular books where selected and the author offers no explaination .
this would destroy any flow that happened to exist , which in this case none does .
and when it did not happen i felt cheated .
then why are so many people still disputing it ?
i could n't not get into this book at all .
the subject matter is interesting , but the writer is in too much of a hurry and that seriously detracts from the story .
i think the main problem was i did not find any of the main characters likeable .
she barely even hugs them in a friendly way . i guessed who the killer was about halfway through .
the characters were lifeless and the plot a snore .
however , this book was a letdown . most everything in this book was common knowledge or common sense .
also , it 's really a drag to read about an empty marriage that goes on and on without resolution .
your mileage may vary but i thought is was bad .
" uninspired " is the kindest word that comes to mind .
i selected it hoping for a good gothic mystery .
this book is n't at all what i had hoped it would be .
" it was real hard . "
maybe i am missing something but i think it is dreadfully boring , i ca n't keep any of the characters straight , and it just drags .
i could not seem to get into the book and want to continue .
most of the content is so negative it is unbelievable .
! only slightly positive portion is on hormones ... but the library , online sources and grocery store checkout magazines tell you more ( prevention )
the writing is amateurish , the examples are elementary , the structure of presentation is not thought through , the authors do n't seem to have much depth of experience .
i do n't care about these things , because every once in a while , all i want is a pat answer to a weighty question .
this is a huge overstatement , to equate worship with the offices .
-- do n't waste your time nor your money .
the plot is thin and characters not fully developed .
the only reason i finished listening to it was that i did n't have another audiobook yet .
unprofessional , typos , errors in basic grammar , poorly written .
but do n't expect me to believe most of what is printed .
that is the problem with this book : it relies primarily on appeals to emotion rather than good scholarship .
bored all the way through .
this book is slow , boring , and predictable .
in the opening pages i could n't get past that she mentally rolled her eyes at college students who would ask a question .
i did n't even like him in this book .
also , the theory is almost certainly false .
a lot of the descriptions are corny .
sexual language : moderate to strong , but not often used .
tell me ... how is one supposed to get to know characters on a personal level , when the only thing we 're reading is narration ?
i did n't even find the front cover very interesting to look at ( but i do n't judge a book by its cover , anyway ) .
the author simply seems to be giving his personal opinion , which is basically opposed to any faith that is n't his .
i did not even come close to finishing .
what is troublesome is the poor editing - repeats of entire sections , stories , calling people by pronouns before mentioning their actual names , just a lot of confusion .
if you practice fighting techniques you should learn at least a little , but the main character does n't seem able to learn .
i did n't care for both perspectives .
and this book is really just her attempt at manipulating men in her sexist paradigm to try to better serve women in relationships .
pass this one by , do n't waste your money .
i was unable to become involved with either couple , their thoughts and their total lack of emotion or any kind of mature involvement .
this book has an interesting story for the readers but the author has nothing on his mind except endless sex and drinking bouts .
it was beautifully written but hard to follow , confusing , could not attach to any characters and did not learn anything useful historically .
and gave birth ( i guess so we can " ooh " and " ah " over a baby ) .
also , the book does n't really follow - through on ideas that seem good .
shame
its so boring !
the only problem is i started to immensely dislike the " heroine " .
i never figured it out . beyond that , the characters were okay , but not very exciting .
this book was a bad read .
the writing becomes very draggy and drawn out .
to me this book is not written well , practical and it is not that clear .
she rushed thru this book .
i did finish the book but did not feel any better by doing so .
i would not spend time or money with another book like this .
the quest for the antidote continues and it gets wearisome and annoying , actually .
and why was n't this included in the initial room description if it 's so important ?
i hate books that are so boring at the start that i have to force myself to read .
but there are so many convoluted side stories leading nowhere and serving no purpose that the story line is obscured .
obviously , this was exciting but it was n't what i expected , and the bad writing just did n't do the idea justice . find more reviews on by blog !
i found myself saying " really ?
the book was vulgar .
sadly as a result , this critical reviewer is not even ready to throw in a " look forward to hearing more from the author " comment .
i stopped reading and moved on .
this book is entirely too slow .
she 's worse .
and this was a totally arbitrary separation that was perpetuated by any new offspring being automatically assigned the same designation as the parents . not genetics .
the author of this book broke his vow with the geisha who dictated this book , misrepresented events that never took place , and is full of abusive talk and action .
all of the characters are greatly underdeveloped and frankly , pretty dull .
that author does not merely list events , but rather explains the importance of events and why things happened as they did .
the word choice was frequently awkward , and several sentences were just confusing or clumsy .
not worth reading in my opinion .
it started out with real promise and could have been so much better .
they behave and act and do and move , but they do n't feel .
i would pass on this one !
it went away - but the weight never did .
they mostly mention their fear of his punishment .
this is not called knowledge at all .
extremely vulgar and impossible to finish even with multiple attempts .
if she were to discover she 's bisexual , that could be interesting , but the explanation given is unbelievable . the end of the book is sloppy and rushed .
this book was another book with the same premise .
but to an outsider , the book seems grossly overwritten .
i 'm not going to say it is n't worth the read- even if i did hate it or think it was terrible in every way .
the book was just lacking something .
perhaps , it is not probable to the extent that it is impossible .
or why not the old unequal approach of " to each according to need " ?
otherwise , do not waste your time or money reading this book !
it was hard to enjoy .
i should have sent it back as i do n't even know if i will use it .
he did break taboos , but he did n't thereby manage to be in any identifiable sense an interesting or good writer .
it should have been sold for less and stated that it was in bad shape .
if you have an older ipod , do n't buy this book .
rather than acknowledging such issues , he simply says they acted with " wanton stubbornness " and effectively abandoned their child .
you 're better off just reading the reviews .
i do n't intend to finish it .
i do not have to write a positive review for the book , but i do have to disclose that i received it for free .
overall , not a good purchase .
i might read the next one if i was feeling masochistic or hopeful , but honestly , i hope i do n't .
it was laziness and lack of thought , coupled to arrogance .
i found the text to be very poorly written .
i read on in the hopes of a plot twist or something but nothing happened .
the story certainly had some moments of chills and was unpredictable , but it seemed unfinished and disjointed .
this is just making it worse , and i consider it highly irresponsible for her to push this view .
i suggest reading an excerpt / sample before buying / reading .
i found it very dull , not at all thrilling .
such a statement is merely another example of the self - pity and self - fascination endemic to the feminist mind .
it was n't what i expected at all .
i&#8217;m a guy and i&#8217;d like to apologize to all women .
the book does not say .
so the book was totally wrong .
shallow characters , loose plot , cliched writing style , dumb ending .
this book was pretty disappointing on all fronts .
just read it for book club .
and whatever happened to having complete faith in the person you are supposedly in love with ?
" quit trying to be clever .
i could n't see anywhere that this was addressed later on .
there was no point in finishing it anyway as you guess from the very 1st chapter ( or the title ! )
no such prose appears in this book .
no sympathy for either character .
where the heck has she gone ? ! ?
and why does she feel this way ?
seriously , did anyone else get as annoyed over the meaningless laughter , interspersed with all the other bad writing ?
it may be that i missed some illusive point ; i looked for it .
the plot was laboured and the style was ordinary .
if d&d nerds got literature degrees they would write this book , and it would be just as myopic , self - absorbed and sophmoric as this drivel .
worst of all , the photographs used to show the different styles are washed out .
you need to pay attention more to your reviews and less to your ego .
the premise is contrived and the biblical content negligible .
the characters mostly had different , albeit irritating , personalities .
i could n't agree more with the majority of readers who find thisbook vapid , shallow , and completely boring .
very dissapointing
that way , if you end up not liking it , you wo n't have wasted money on it like i did .
i ordered this book based on reviews .
very disappointed !
plot seemed bland and boring to me .
" i do n't know what happened .
the story just fell flat , leaving a lot to be desired in the end .
but there 's never a shortage of positive reviews , whether legitimate or not .
do n't bother reading
the non - baseball stuff is at least interesting at times but otherwise has almost no redeeming value .
although the writing quality in this " true haunting " example is much better than some i have read , i still found it boring .
this , on the other hand , was not up to par .
but like an accident on the highway , i wanted to see how bad it would get .
at least check it out of the library instead of spending money on it .
anyway , the book was great up until the last few chapters , and then it just did n't make sense .
i would n't have purchased this book if it had n't been for my theology class .
not a good buy .
the problem is heartwrenching and extremely expensive . unfortunately this book wo n't do a thing to attack that problem .
i also found it a tad dull .
save your time and money !
too much distraction to try to read this book
if you are midway through the book and decide you do n't like it , do n't bother plodding through because you will only feel cheated .
also ... the author does n't give the glycemic load for any of the recipes .
well , it was boring , it was depressing , and the big surprise was an insult to my intelligence .
i do n't even recognize these people , and certainly do n't like them .
the plot , or lack of .
no backup ?
for example , exhibit 1 - 20 source : flow of funds , authors .
this one however left me cold
i think my biggest problem was with the author .
i do n't want to indicate that the book is trash .
it does not get better !
however , her stuttering sometimes miraculously disappears for pages on end .
i wasted my time reading it and learned nothing
but these do not redeem the book .
i just was n't into reading this once a ordered it .
i ordered this book because it was supposed to be about produce - thinking primarily vegetables and fruits , and possibly some whole grains .
let 's get down to the dirt : this title started off strong .
however , she seemed more miserable , and toward this story 's end , crazy rather than truly wicked .
nothing doing !
the characters were n't really fleshed out that well either .
unless i missed something & # 34;when did he do all this shooting ?
i think the author put too many of her interests in it instead of telling the story .
i feel like i was dropped midway through a story and forced to try to figure it out .
please let there be a pony this time ...
i could n't figure out where the plot was or where the book was possibly going to i stopped reading .
i stopped buying the books a long ago , i would go to the library .
that does n't quite work , either .
the sex scenes are all savage and i do not know what point the author is trying to make .
but , that 's not why i bought the book . in summary , this book reads like i wrote it - dull plot and no motivation .
and , finally , the ending is just plain silly and not very intersting .
she cited no references to back up her assertions .
i was captured by the title , but disappointed by the content .
i 'm a ravenous reader but most of these stories i could n't finish .
... but i just could not get ' into ' this book .
do n't see anything that 's appealing to my taste .
just did n't have what it takes to keep me interested .
it was like reading people magazine - satisfying while waiting in the dentist 's office or on a long flight , then completely forgettable .
i found this on the " new books " shelf at the local library and took it home for a look - see . i must say , i was disappointed .
the book is full of factual errors , extreme bias , bitterness and misrepresentations .
they give each other horrible nick names .
do you have sex , want sex , ever think about sex ?
obviously , this book did n't have that either .
what contrived , arrogant drivel !
it is a weird overly sentimental and cheaply emotional meeting of disturbed people .
but all my interest was replaced by disappointment as i began reading and painfully continued to read the book .
but it suddenly took a turn for the worse when a pair of philosophical - minded rats unexpectedly entered the narrative .
this is a very smart , very stupid book .
what is it supposed to be anyway ?
this book is a waste of a good book , money and your time .
meanwhile , the bad demons are on the rise and oh my gosh , what happened ?
while i like the book , i just stopped reading after this one because i do n't want to keep paying for something with no ending .
it just does n't fit for those claimed to be abused as badly as they were .
it came out of nowhere so fast that i got whiplash .
convoluted and rambling .
he says , " it 's moving , but it 's not getting anywhere . "
then it plunges downhill rapidly .
it was not necessarily a bad book , but it was definitely not the fabulous book i thought it was going to be .
someone * might * recommend this book to teenage girls looking to get their feet wet in the fantasy genre .
now it is flat , pastel and worse yet , has writing on the bottom of the colored side .
unlike other books , i can not recommend these extraordinarily poor pages to anyone , not a single person .
i 'm not a man - hater by any stretch of the imagination but this just was n't a realistic portrayal of how people in the real world act .
i do n't understand what the author was trying to do here .
she did not do her research .
did she lose the weight ?
the book does not hold your interest .
but then he slit his wrists in angst over their refusal .
i usually thoroughly enjoy her books , but this one was really disappointing .
dark pools run by broker houses are the main obstacle and should not be allowed .
a famous , successful author trying a new field of writing .
the characters are n't developed .
the writer needs to spend more time and thought working on this one
reading the book , however , left me numb and frustrated .
it does nt seem like this series is over but i do hope that if they add to it that it will be better .
she had no reason to not tell them about him .
it would seem the above named " authors " have built a " frame " upon which they hang another poorly thought out and poorly written " plot " .
i do n't see what is interesting about that .
i thought it would be similar to the fruit hunters , which i adore , but alas , i could not even finish it .
it turns out the real author had permission to submit his own novella ... also uninspired .
after scanning through the rest of the book , i was disappointed that no distinct prayers to god were offered .
eve was manipulative , self - centered , spoiled , immature , and had absolutely no compassion for any other human being .
then it took an ugly turn down a long tunnel into a cesspool of crap .
the repetitive nature of the dialogue and descriptions makes even the graphic descriptions of s&m boring by the end !
if you think that the book may upset you or your small ones , or if it offends you or your values , then do not buy it .
it is a waste of money .
when i finally decided my life was too short to stomach unattractive characters , hardly any plot and pretentious writing , i felt a weight had lifted from me .
her heroine , patience , is not very sympathetic .
characters made decisions that did n't make any sense at all .
so clearly the problem lies with me , not with her .
words that go on and on but nothing happens .
i hated this book , i was never able to finish it , i just deleted it .
stop wasting your time preparing for the test .
i just did n't like her book , in a big way .
in romances , like this one i think you can get away with alot , but honestly , i just could n't get into this one .
the premise ( as best i can determine what that was ) seems fabulous , but the execution was ultimately quite disappointing .
i can not believe it was written by a professional writer !
save your money and spend it on something more interesting .
to me the book seemed to take along time and still get nowhere at the end .
what a complete waste of my money and time .
the characters are stock figures , and the motive for murder is thin .
then ... the downward spiral began .
the ending was so bad ! ! !
her cough is one of her defining features , and yes , it 's extremely irritating .
the excessive , unnecessary descriptions insult the reader 's intelligence .
although the writing and the idea behind the story are ok , there is something a little bit off about this book .
this book is not about bad liquor .
this is an unsatisfactory book that left me feeling a little empty and unfulfilled at the end of it .
by the ending i could n't care less about the characters .
i recommend not wasting money on this massive waste of paper .
but the way the story unfolds is unconvincing .
it sounded good in the review .
i kept hoping for the book to deliver .
his sentences should have been stronger .
i can normally get through unpleasant images in a book , but this book contains so many that i could n't finish it .
and with sex occurring so early in the story , there was no sexual tension to speak of . a big disappointment all around .
lastly , the conflict resolution was just too neat .
it appears that writers are so pushed for deadlines that their writing becomes rather mundane .
i grew bored with this book very quickly .
i&#8217;m not saying she sucked or anything but she had no interests , no hobbies , and no real personality besides in her head .
also , there is a constant self - important and self - congratulatory tone to the author 's writing , that i found irritating .
i was so excited for this release .
it 's not one i can recommend to other readers .
this occurs for page after page , chapter after chapter . i do n't find this affectation to be stylish at all .
the ability of this author to separate himself from his characters does n't exist , and it shows . i'm not a writing snob .
i found the book superficial and redundant .
would that be good or bad ?
no characters are fully realized , and cheap symbolism is casually thrown about with little apparent link to anything .
his claim is that god does not act unless a person prays .
after awhile , it was really annoying .
i felt too much explanation was given on the last book that was n't even hinted on the previous ones .
the reader has to wade through the descriptions to get to the plot .
the book was slow , parts of the book were just not logical , and the ending seemed rushed .
it had very little momentum and did not hold my interest .
it was implausible that spade could fall for someone like that .
i 'm really trying to figure out if all of these good reviews are friends of his ?
i ca n't believe a publisher or an author would let something as error - laden as this go to market .
some of the stuff in this book is okay and some i kinda questioned .
instead i got an autobiography about some cop who 's experiences are pretty boring .
sadly , there is very little depth .
now , is it reasonable to think there are hordes of outraged citizens reading my review and instantly trying to get it deleted by posting identical criticisms ?
the plot was rather far fetched but could have been redeemed with good characters .
but here it was comically so . as i wrote earlier , i appreciated the broad strokes of the plot and felt there was some real potential .
overall it feels like this one is following the literary leaders , but is a decent read if it 's your type .
tiresome to read on and on in this vein .
i could n't tell you why . and it did n't have to be this way .
i was very disappointed for a variety of reasons .
there were too many voices .
she spends more time trashing earlier methods of training than writing a training book of practical relevance .
if the reasoning remains on the same level , it should be good for a laugh , if nothing else .
his publishers certainly did him no favor letting this mess go to press .
this book was boring from page one .
i am sorry that i spent the money to purchase this book .
aside from the plot ( what plot ?
not as good as i expected .
" hard " science fiction ?
this modern day dog crap should be burned and deleted from the kindle servers like the virus it is .
yes , we are flawed - but where were the characters in this novel who were trying to live right ?
i ended up skimming over this horrible sham of a book .
i could n't get interested and i had to make a list of " who is who " to keep track of all the characters .
a character would look at another character 's face or expression and figure out what the other was thinking in the same glance .
i wanted to really like this book .
that 's fine for a high school book , but not middle school .
it is very limited in notes and is not a study bible at all .
he reminded me an aging soap opera star .
others might not notice or care , for me the switches between past and present tense were jarring .
this is n't just blind .
why does n't she simply start her own paper ?
the bad guys in this book are so one - dimensional and predictable they belong in a comic book .
i found it somewhat painful to get through .
like several of his sequels , this book is a let down ... it does n't really have a clear plot or purpose .
the characters were all too weird for my taste .
then it ends with some pretentious quoting of actual literature . whew .
i get that the whole idea is that love can conquer all , but it just seemed to be a bit heavy - handed .
should be overwritten .
this lagging writing behavior made the story boring and difficult to continue .
the last reader who reviewed this book did a detailed discussion of the plot so i will not rehash it very much .
not particularly in terms of sexual tension , but excitement in general .
i found it a complete waste of my money .
this book was boring to me and i did not finish it !
so please be warned you might not finish the whole story .
not well edited .
if you want to find out what happened just read the other one star reviews with spoilers and save your money .
it was kind of dragged out , so much so that i found myself skipping pages .
uninspired and lacking chemistry or sizzle of any kind .
it really does n't come across as such .
but less than 1/4th is devoted to actual evidence of the resurrection . i should of read some of this book before buying it .
i do n't know if it had something to do with insulin from the sudden onslaught of carbs ... or what the problem was .
this is not literature !
life 's too short to waste on this book .
( oh , but he 's probably a vegan .
she spent too much time delving into the introspection of the character and not enough time outside building the story .
it is informative but not as much as i was hoping .
you could insert " character 1 , " " character 2 , " etc .
the overall plot was n't something i cared about .
the number of pages listed for the actual writing is misleading .
this could have been a good book if the author had focused on telling an interesting story in full rather than creating an extended summary of a movie script idea .
sylvain should have thrown out ingredients that may have been touched by a thief .
it seemed to me that the purpose of the author may have been to write as much as possible without saying anything substantive .
i understand what the author was trying to achieve , but sorry , fell way short of the goal .
the characters and the story were so underdeveloped i was difficult to read .
i would say the book has some value as an overview , but not much else .
it 's virtually all rehash and nothing original .
i 'm not arguing the book should n't exist , obviously .
ending was fun , even if it was a little too neat . what i did not like about this book : poor character development , especially the villains .
he has a crowd of followers who applaud anything he says , so he does n't have to work too hard .
more hogwash .
after several chapters , this becomes increasingly annoying .
a safe word is supposed to be something that would n't usually come up during sex so thing do n't get confusing .
it 's clear from the other reviews i 'm in the minority , but i was profoundly disappointed by this entry in the jane lawless series .
warning this book should have restrictions for minors do to the overly gross and sadistic writings .
this book was just a rehash of other books with nothing inventive in it .
this is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages .
this book is not only insulting the fairy tales but also my vocabulary .
i found myself speed reading and after a while actually tempted to just not finish .
the so called " facts " have nothing to do with reality .
i gave up on it exactly halfway through the book .
here 's hoping that , in future installments , he rambles less and narrates more .
i find it very muddled with which category to put it in .
there is practically no sex ; if there is it is cursory .
) , and a worse writer .
this , however , had the potential to be good but its disappointing and with a rushed unsatisfying ending , i ca nt honestly recommend this book .
the typeface on this book is extremely small .
this book did for some reason .
conversation as character development strategy felt contrived .
it seems the author wrote this book in a hurry .
i would have returned it but it simply is not worth the postage .
other than some of the moral aspects of the protagonist 's character , this boook moves right along , even tho its plot is simplistic .
probably not ?
the character 's evolution through the story 's traumas has some mild interest , but now much of it comes across as trite .
we looked at each other in disbelief .
i am floored by the positive reviews on this book .
for shame !
it read like a soap opera with really weak characters .
to find out that i have to buy the sequel to finish the story is more than disappointing , it 's dishonest .
i had a readers block trying to pick it up and wonder if the author had writer 's block .
did n't give as much in depth information as i was lead to believe .
she also began to suspect that he was n't the political radical she had thought .
none of the hair found at the scene belonged to the so - called " hippies " .
it did n't speak to me .
this book is not as controversial as depicted .
i 'm sad to say that i really did n't enjoy this story .
i normally read a series in order , but i broke that rule for this book because the premise seemed so interested .
i 'll get the paper version and use a magnifying glass .
about halfway through the book i gave up .
just never seemed to grab me , i kept waiting to be pulled into the twists of the storyline over the erotica , but it just got lost .
this is a disjointed story that takes a long time to develop and then abruptly ends .
but she 's ok , because she only steals from rich people .
it has very little of substance and is very gossipy .
rambling is not literature .
i wanted to give this book a try .
the book itself is okay .
it 's straight downhill from there .
it takes too long to get in to with no pay off .
i just had no interest in most of the people mentioned in this book .
for example , the book is much longer than it needs to be .
i found the formatting annoying .
combine that with the sparse plot , meaning very little is actually happening other than verbal exchanges among characters , and you get an altogether annoying waste of time and money .
other reviews surmise that he is trying to make a buck ... perhaps .
not just women either . comedy and zombies have their place .
i understand having to tell his state of mind but it seemed to go on and on .
i just could nt wade through this .
do n't you care ?
this time , i just could n't get into this particular book .
but how do you get a newborn to fall asleep ? ? ?
this novel was a complete waste of my time .
it is full of boring characters an uncompelling storyline and witless turgid prose . totally inept on all levels !
much of it is not specific to writing romances .
various writings show he shared the common male attitude of his time : women were less intelligent than men and full of " useless chatter . "
the end of the book drops off badly and it strikes me that at this stage , the author could n't wait to hand it over to the publisher .
no longer .
i do n't know if he 's lost his touch or he 's just too busy making money to care -- people keep buying his books anyway .
i have to admit when i read this i became frustrated , bored and confused .
no spoilers here !
the author 's understanding of other human beings seems to begin & end with a portion of anatomy found below the waist .
i was expecting this book to be something different than what it ended up being .
save your money and do n't buy this .
buy " founding brothers : the revolutionary generation " instead .
some of the language seemed a little childish and the characters not very real .
this is a quick read and very disappointing .
the book drug in many parts , while the action scenes sped by too fast aided by all - to - convenient rescues .
is this supposed to be revenge for his sleeping with caro at the start of the book ?
warning , spoilers .
the main character was beyond childish .
did they respect him ?
i never wrote a bad review before -- if i do n't care for a book , i do n't review it .
i simply did n't enjoy this book and will hesitate to buy another from this writer .
this may be what you 're looking for , it 's just not my cup of tea .
burroughs repeatedly tries to paint himself as a loving , innocent kid , but if his memoirs are any indication , he 's a spoiled , ungrateful brat .
.. and , as it is such an idiot book what does this say about the author ?
i then went online to actually research the book .
it seemed like she had no common sense in this book and that she really did n't care about the safety of herself or her family .
too much time is wasted describing people who have nothing to do with the main story .
so i skipped ahead a few stories and tried again ... still nothing .
it seemed as if too many parts were fabricated .
at least i did n't have to pay hard - earned money for it .
she does n't clarify that at all .
this is a tasteless book in that you can jump over large tracts and really not miss anything interesting .
save your time and money , awful , awful book .
after making his readers force themselves to read all the way through this boring story , he then rewards his faithful readers with an insanely maddening cliff hanger of an ending .
potential but fell way short .
from any other author , it would get less than one star .
really pretty lame .
this is yet another boring but so much more underneath it all girl meets shiny new guy novel .
i ended up hating bess and i doubt that was the author 's intent .
i blame the editors for allowing it to be published without some fact checking .
i am gay and i even found the cavalier attitudes and descriptions of homosexual sex in this book vile and unnecessary .
it left me flat .
the problem is that the author does n't know much about prostitutes .
perhaps if i had not been trying to read it on my own , i could have stuck with it .
she tries to be careful .
while the idea for the plot is intriguing , the book is not .
worse , he provides little explanation for his code examples .
there were elements of suspense and surprise but not too interesting or striking .
but instead it is about photographic criticism , primarily written .
it is hard to describe how poorly researched , poorly thought out , and poorly written this book really is .
the story is just a setup for the sequel , therefore not worth the time .
the author 's reading of her book came across as flat and lifeless .
i kept thinking it was some sort of joke , which i guess it was .
however , the artwork just was n't for me .
about halfway into the book , i realized why .
she also seems rather obsessed with matters relating to sex .
apparently martini , run out of juice and started scratching the empty barrel of his imagination to produce something which would keep his bank account fat .
i was confused and a bit annoyed at the way she left her boyfriend , and the rest of the story seemed rushed and the end was very disjointed .
as a short story , this might have worked , but there is n't enough here for a novel .
do n't get me wrong , i enjoy the development of sexual tension and satisfaction in a novel .
i found the story dull , the characters either annoying or despicable , and the writing often clumsy .
if you 're a writer and you 're tired of these kinds of false ideals , please do something .
i did like the idea that everyone has a secret , whether it be good or bad .
i think this author needs to hire a ghost writer and let someone else tell her story .
i just did not enjoy it and persisted in reading it in the hope that it would get better .
this , above all else , made finishing it difficult .
it seemed like the writer just wanted to titillate & disgust readers .
she repeatedly says she thinks he 'll be a force of good in politics , yet nothing in his character says that to me as a reader .
the author could not make up her mind who this woman was .
it is nothing but trite bodice - ripper trash , not even worthy of the paper it is printed upon .
it 's just depressing , disgusting , and crude .
even then , the whole incident is completely superfluous to the overall narrative , and it has no discernable effect on the rest of the book .
honestly , i do n't know what it is and hate myself for saying this , but i simply did not like this book .
disjointed .
furthermore , the convoluted sentences and clumsy euphemisms distance the reader from the action .
as others have noted , there are barely any gluten - free recipes in this book .
i could n't understand the choices made by the characters or by the author herself .
very little variation in sentence structure or voice , and i would 've found the vocabulary interesting somewhere in junior high .
i felt like we were building up to something big and wonderful and it was just such a let down for me .
i seem to be in the minority on this book .
this is a dangerous book for a hurting woman to read .
it did not hold my interest and it seemed to repeat itself over and over . i'm sorry to sound so negative but this is what it was for me .
unfortunately , this one was not a page turner for me .
i bought this book because of the reviews and was i ever disappointed .
she 's using the book to preach her own religious views .
not only that , but strangely enough the more exciting parts of the book are rushed through , as if the action is an obstacle to be skipped over .
but before they completely cast aside mountains of research , they usually demand some proof .
this book is done very poorly .
her character development was weak , and i did n't connect with her .
conversations go on way too long , dancing and horseback riding and still no clue into deciphering what what they were going to find out .
this book is self - centered and boring .
i found it really hard to care about any of the characters .
my opinion obviously is that if you have substance ( soul stuff , philosophy , a lesson learned that you seek to teach , etc .
it has nothing , nothing to do with shamanism .
this is not only bad reading but also bad pleading .
" i had a sucky upbringing so i 'm going to go kill some man who may or may not be my father ? "
at least you get that assumption from the author .
her extreme overuse of names & full ; names was over the top & annoying .
i found this book incredibly boring .
god , this book is dumb !
not that i have anything against gratuitous sex ; i 'd just rather do as opposed to read about doing ... what can i say ?
i 've been skimming and skipping just to get to the end , but it seems endless .
it took me so long to get through this book , because i just was n't interested after a while .
attempts to bring life to the characters of the story fall flat .
pointless rubbish .
it was kinda pointless .
it 's the same way with the formula in the elite ops books .
the characters have no depth , no real feel .
did this link already broken ?
and i did nt see the reason why she had to have so many curse words , and then get all preachy at the same time .
this one just did n't capture my imagination .
i did not feel invested in the characters or the story .
be warned , however : the road is long , slow , and ( sad to admit ) disappointing , on the verge of boring .
i 'm not exactly sure what i was expecting from this book , but what i found was n't it .
seriously , i could n't read between them .
the point of the book is to throw his mother under the bus .
i almost wanted to stop reading at this point because i thought , " what kind of hero is this that cheats on his girlfriend ? "
the final nail in the coffin for me was the reason one character gives for not saving another character who was in terrible danger .
when you 're so busy yawning over the writing it 's impossible to give a toss about any message .
the only reason i finished listening to it was to find out if anyone survived , even though by the end i really could not have cared less about the characters .
after reading so many positive reviews , i was disappointed and unable to finish this book .
' this is logic ?
just plain weird ...
she looks dull and boring until he arranges a makeover and she becomes a raving beauty .
this work does n't really help , although it uses " rape .
i do n't recommend this book .
i stopped reading it after this book .
the author 's attempt to engage me in the chase failed and i could not recommend this book .
but the plot and characters seem contrived and far too easy .
i do n't regret buying this one , but it wo n't go onto my ' reread this ' pile .
" , i hear you not even being interested enough to ask , " you said you did n't like short stories so is n't that a good thing ? "
too many men , too many story lines , too little of interest to keep the reader going .
it was boring , tedious , and a huge beating .
it 's not that the book was wholly bad .
instead of telling a story , the author presents statistics , conclusions , and opinions .
i do n't like reading authors that use their fiction books for a personal platform .
tried too hard .
he ignores the roll of government in the disaster . all books and authors have unstated assumptions built into their presentations .
the premise is something i would normally get in to , but it just didn&#8217;t grab me .
it was a frustrating .
and the random passages of her thoughts on various nothings - honestly .
if the author was n't going to take an objective view on things , it 's hard to sell the arguments to readers .
nevermind the fact that there 's not one definition of spirituality and that its all subjective .
along the way , however , are mostly uninteresting or implausible developments .
i figured hey , maybe it might be okay ...... wrong ! !
mission earth is downright insulting to our intelligence in some parts .
in fact , the book seems like a random selection of snippets poorly woven into a jumble of meaningless paragraphs .
there were too many loose ends left unanswered and it felt rushed .
the hot gunfights were boring !
cardboard characters with no depth .
this book , however , reinforced the truth that even when grammatically correct , something can be poorly written .
i naively believed that a book like this would n't be published if it contained irresponsible information in it that could be harmful to babies .
the storyline is ok , but to me , there is no real chemistry between the characters .
i kept waiting for it to get better and it just did n't .
cardboard villains , cliched heroes , and minimal plot .
hard to believe it was the same author ... not at all the enjoyable experience of her debut .
( note the lack of spoiler warning , there : i do n't believe in hiding rape scenes .
i did n't really care for this book , mainly because the characters were all so annoying , i did n't care what happened to them .
it just did n't seem necessary to express every thought by every character in the book .
what a waste of my time this series has been .
i think the problem lies within the authors , not the community he tries to condemn .
it 's basically glossed over .
its a self published book .
the heroine seemed to be someone i could n't relate to .
save your money , save your time , thank me later .
it is maddening to read about a country in which such things were considered normal and acceptable . however , i felt that this book fell short of its potential .
it was simply a poorly written book with foolish dialogue for the most part .
vapid and insufferable characters .
i give it one star only because you apparently have to give it at least that or the system wo n't accept your review . save your money .
she is actually quite unpleasant . the story is well written , but i skimmed a lot of it to get to the interesting parts .
also her whole forgive and forget attitude about being murdered was ridiculous .
sadly , i was quite disappointed .
instead i found that most theories discussed were common sense , or not explored to the depth i would have liked .
what a bore this was !
she spends less time grieving for her child than she does her husband !
the book description sounded so good and promising - oh , well .
not completely scriptural .
unfortunately it was much too dark for me .
however they are not well - integrated , and come across almost as if the authors had been told by their publisher 's editor to " add more detail " .
my conflict is that the author only retells parts of the book that have already happened as though to meet some required amount of pages for the publisher .
i never actually finished reading the book , it was so bad . the writer needs a lot more editorial control regarding pace and structure .
dated and oblivious , this book does n't offer near enough contemporary input for marital partners .
god , what an egotist .
... nah , not really .
it was rushed , and it suffered .
the phrases " god - awful , " and " unspeakably horrible " come to mind .
this reads like a high school freshman 's attempt to write a popular story and falls far short of the mark .
where were the editors in this bit of work ?
i lost interest in the story as i began to count the errors .
the ploy line is broad and highly predictable .
not a lot of romance .
will not buy again .
i really tried to like this story because it was so original like nothing else i had ever read but i had a hard time finishing it .
i guess i should stick to what i know .
in comparison with his other books , this one misses novelty and new / updated data on current condition of the environment .
a couple of random people help out the good guy .
i was lost , lost , lost .
there was nothing remotely interesting about the scenario .
slow , because it is boring .
the author tries to portray the heroine as spunky but she comes off as thoroughly childish .
i seriously doubt that i will even give her books another try .
even his early grammar school years had actual dialogue passages . the books was n't as interesting or insightful as i had expected .
there was nothing witty or interesting about the conversations .
so i gave it up , but that does n't mean other readers wo n't enjoy it .
but she appears to be annoyed about it the entire time .
therefore it is hard to care about characters you do n't know .
there is no drama , no center of action or plot .
lastly , the book ended abruptly as if the author just got sick of writing and quit .
the writing did n't make me cringe , but the storyline and main character did .
the margins are tiny and the book is not nice to handle .
i am not a doctor , and not equipped to do so .
and , in my opinion the book was too , well , i guess , i do n't know .
maybe if the author explained more of the ` point of this story ' from the beginning of this book , perhaps it ` might ' have made more sense ?
you know the plot contrived , and the characters are cliches , and the dialogue is ridiculous , yet somehow you just keep watching ...
most characters did not deserve this ending .
not worth it if you 're not actually studying the subject or have advanced interest in psycho - analysis .
the descriptions are seriously lacking and almost everything is boring , boring , boring .
it was a case of the authors never could get the story on the correct track .
it was neither helpful nor encouraging to read this book in which the author states she controls her weight only by being constantly hungry .
save yourself a disappointment , and spend your money on mars bars instead - you will still be better off than with this book .
i do n't really understand why .
i could n't get past that , among other inconsistencies - i.e.
book is going back to the library mostly unread .
( that quote may not be verbatim . )
the index is horrible .
so save your money and do not bother with this book .
who just sit around in a maze eating free cheese that was not produced by anyone .
it was just a bit boring for me .
i wanted to at least say i read the story .
do n't buy this ... the world has even problems without adding this book to the list !
he is not that good of a novelist .
this book has horrible penmanship and was a waste of trees .
seriously , all of her possible scenarios , many of which are just extraneous information , just detract from the presentation of " evidence " .
my husband and i finished the book , but were mostly driven by how bad it was and " could it get any worse . "
on that level , i guess it works .
the society in which events occur is implausible .
the plot was thin to the point of anorexia .
this series just is n't for me .
i would have stopped midway , ( and should have ) , but kept hoping something good would turn the book around .
the characters became predictable and what little bit of plot was there , was quickly forgotten .
that is , the author drops many other author 's names and titles , intellectual concepts ( such as " biological imperative " ) , and obscure terms .
the character development was poor and overall the book just was n't exciting in spite of a somewhat decent plot line .
readers who have not read the bdb series might enjoy this book ; i advise those who have to look elsewhere .
the dialogue is undifferentiated and unconvincing .
halfway through i could n't take it anymore .
the book reads as a lunatic fringe conservative diatribe rather than speculative fiction , and the overly manipulated plot is so full of coincidence that i finally gave up on it .
the character development is shallow and predictable .
i 'm fine with authors sticking to a formula that works , but within reason .
i prefer to figure out some things about a story on my own instead of having each motive and cause - and - effect issue spelled out for me .
the whole thing about southern speak was silly and overplayed .
like others have said , the quality of the writing is poor .
does n't anyone know how to write without insert disgusting descriptions of sex and perversion .
the ending seemed rushed and many of the issues raised were left unresolved .
i think it is very sad when an author attempts to write a story with silly cliches simply to fill the pages .
parts of this book were cute , but for the most part , i could not help but think that her fiance was too good for her .
i found the writing amateurish and awkward .
unfortunately , this book did not really live up to my expectations and while i liked some aspects of it , there were many more i had a problem with .
this latest effort seems geared to a young teenage mentality and could , in fact , have been written by a teenager , given the very , very amateurish writing .
we are reminded over and over again how different she was to the rest of them , but i actually found her voice annoyingly flat and dull .
what else bothered me ?
stupid , boring , awful , shallow ( much more than shallow ! )
but something felt dry in the reading .
there were several contradictions that were annoying and i could n't believe that with all the editing nobody caught them .
your attitude is as immature as your writing .
it was n't nearly as good as his others .
i ca n't believe i actually paid money for this piece of junk .
just was n't my cup of tea but might be for others
maybe i should have paid for the " premium " hardcover edition ...
hmmm ... i do n't think these other reviewers are particularly judicious in throwing their stars around .
the boat chase at the start of the book did not translate will , nor did the mountain chase .
i could not finish the whole book and would not recommend it to anyone .
no ... no such luck .
i certainly ca n't argue about its basic premise .
sadly , it was all downhill from there . i'm really not sure how to describe how terrible the rest is .
the writing is good ... in a bland , uninspired way .
i 'm sure other 's could have done the same but did n't .
story into which i was drawn - did n't exist .
it just seemed very slow .
the trial was slightly interesting , but overall i really did n't find any new characters that i liked or that held my interest .
the cops were likable characters but even there the author relied a bit on stereotypes .
perhaps the author was stealing from herself ?
the book is about nothing , just bunch of notes that are not connected and sometimes seem out of place .
she wrote alot about things ( mostly a repeat from previous chapters ) then tried to fast forward things .
for the money your better off somewhere else .
however , nothing is done with the concept .
the others i actually skipped over after losing interest partway through .
this book is so pointless and boring .
story is unlikely and does n't hold together though the author tries to make the ending " surprising " .
his writing style is appalling , the content irrelevant and repetitive and the reader will gain nothing from reading this rubbish .
instead , he ignored the difficult parts and gave no explanation .
however the reason for it never made sense to me .
the plot is weak and the ending was poor .
the cover looks innocent enough like any other kids book .
that is truly the sign of a boring book .
is n't it awful ?
i think this book stinks !
had to stop and think if this was porn i was reading or what .
although he was initially honest about " where he was coming from , " for the rest of the book he completely ignores the origins of his agenda .
i love the author 's pi series but this one i might just totally pass on .
i skipped to the end .
many of the directions mention to open this file or that but alas , i was unable to do so .
not so in this case .
there was just too much going on in this book and the author seemed to be reaching for suspense and character plots that seemed all too fabricated .
i was not impressed with the massive amounts of true facts accumulated in this book , i was confused .
okay , that 's it .
and this is what this story lacks .
of course , historically speaking , the latter argument is much more difficult to sustain than the former .
i found some of the subplots ( following her stepfather , for example ) ludicrous and forced .
what you actually get are books that drag on and on and on .
the plot was not believable and the ending was very weak .
the characters , being paranormal , of course heal in the blink of an eye - nothing to care about there either .
there was little new info .
it was n't very well written and lacked in character definition .
i understand this is a book for popular consumption , not an economics text , but that is no excuse for lack of scholarship from an author who clearly knows better .
the plot holes , sudden and unexplained changes in outlook of the protagonist , and sheer absurdity of some of the premises are not worthy of hard - cover publication .
i suppose that the positive thing about this book is that it made me feel like i could actually get a novel published .
i finished the book not knowing exactly what had happened . the characters were very undeveloped .
this is no davinci code .
no , if you use it as a trivial device for the benefit of a male character .
it was very difficult to read and i 'm not an uneducated person .
she is overly dramatic and very cliche .
however , if you are religious or sensitive in that regard , i would probably give it a miss .
overall it is a let down .
what a bunch of self - serving drivel .
but i tend to tire of the paragraphs that endlessly rehash the characteristics of the individual characters .
he asks the reader to make too many leaps of faith creating a choppy , unpleasant story .
i started reading it and ca n't believe how really terrible this book is .
it was mostly imaginary politics .
i read and read and flipped through pages and kept trying t care about these people .
his talent is there , and the story is well written , but there is so much that i did n't care for .
the very amateurish , almost juvenile writing was practically unbearable , as was the forced dialogue , and the stupidity of every single character in this novel .
what i mean by male ` harem ' is that the protagonist has sexual tension ( not acts ) spread through multiple male characters .
however , missional has its own lacks .
i just could n't stay focused and became so bored with it .
the story was disjointed and unbelievable .
stupid imagination !
waste of resources .
i ended up skimming most of the book after awhile .
as i said above this work is of very limited value .
this book was a big disappointment as it seemed to be a lot of overview review of previous books , even verbatim regurgitation of text .
did not like the characters , the subject matter , the writing , the plot .
the awful news is that i purchased and read this piece of trash .
i truly hope her other works are far superior because if they are not then the publishers should be ashamed of themselves .
i could never warm up to the dominance / submissive aspect , and the premise of the whole book is rather stupid .
it did not grab me in the beginning at all and then when religion was brought into it , it just lost my interest .
the bad guy gets away with it .
etc . as far as the yoga element goes , i found it lacking .
the main character is far too omniscient , even when he claims that he is n't ( which actually makes the trait even more annoying than usual ) .
she was so pathetically weak . i am not trying to hate on the story .
the characters were okay , the plot was okay , the setting was okay , the pacing was okay .
why do i get the sense they are not dealing fairly with the historical sources ?
predictable , poorly written story .
i did n't care who died and did n't die as long as i was able to get to the end and move on to a new book .
it was boring and i was angered by certain elements of the story .
there 's nothing useful in all this , nor are the stories interesting .
additionally , the ending does n't work .
the book is so poorly written that the author did n't even put forth much effort to name his characters .
didion repeats unnecessary details .
i 'm a big fan of hers and that 's why i picked up her book but i found it dull , irritating , poorly written and awful , plain awful .
it was not an enjoyable book .
you find sentences like " in my other book ... " all over the place .
so i do not recommend for you to buy it .
the end was unbelievable .
i gave up on this halfway through , and probably wo n't finish it .
instead , it was combined with the ember series because it was the only way it would sell .
too sprawling ... just poorly edited for my taste .
the plot rambles around way too many subplots . it 's difficult to stay engaged with the story .
what a tremendous waste of paper and ink .
started ok but plot faulted in the middle .
the writer calls on all his requisite , trademark gimmicks but the book simply does n't compare to his better works .
this is why signs of mass consumption are never a good sign of quality .
plot too convoluted , no real chance for the reader to try and guess who the perpetrator might be .
i was tired of the author explaining every detail , it really dragged the book .
this book reads like it was written by a rapist who engages in domestic violence .
i have already given up a lot in life , i am not giving up my coffee ... sorry .
maybe having read the above exemplary authors i expect too much .
oh dear , what is wrong with the many reviews for this book ?
the end was a big disappointment .
however , this sequel falls far short of the original .
the young woman in this episode seems old .
i just did n't feel the hea .
but --- i could n't .
i donated it to the local library - could be just me that did n't think this sequel was anything more than ok .
if you like tasteless , cheap , gaudy stories then go ahead .
seriously tedious book .
the cover was deceiving .
i tried to identify the problem i had with this novel .
because if it were to become the majority ideology , we would all be in serious trouble .
it was dreadful , and i 'm a big star wars fan .
" it 's not that this book is bad , it 's just not very good .
i suppose if you like those airy type of romances this would be your book .
after reading several really good historical fiction books of late i tried this book and was very disappointed .
nothing new , nothing different in this book .
she makes an attempt at the end , but give up without really trying , just asking the questions .
for me , there was a lot of filler in the form of flashbacks , but no real substance in what was happening in real time .
perhaps it is the drugs , but important plot points ( and there is not much plot to begin with ) seem to turn on abrupt , arbitrary ideas or observances .
soon i was skimming multiple pages at a time .
this introduction , while certainly cathartic to the author , was meaningless to the rest of us .
i 've never been a poetry fan ( it 's a sad thing , really ) , so this was n't the book for me .
i hate just reading fillers .
teen angst at its worst .
a lot of content to wade through , in miniscule font on cheap paper , did not make for a good start .
it failed to capture my imagination .
she did n't even seem human with her lack of emotions .
at times there were good insights to chew on , and i did not feel like i wasted my time .
certainly did n't live up to what i expected .
it 's depressing .
it started out decent enough bug then it started to get too far fetched .
same old , same , same same .
( caution : spoiler alert ! )
we 're in the middle of a war here people , the last thing we need is a few whiny people screaming their uninteresting problems to the entire galaxy .
it started out okay , though it felt rushed .
this book was filled with chapter after chapter of debasing thoughts of chauvinistic men .
there is really no believable reason ever given , other than she is bitter and disappointed because she could have gone to a better school or taught in a better school .
i do n't like any of the characters .
i chose this rating because i could n't follow it maybe because i just could n't picture the surroundings .
could not imagine anyone buying the switching birth mother scheme - in a dorm full of other women no less .
this book had some good pictures , the illustrator was talented , but the book could n't decide if the story was for a younger or older child .
do not read .
while trying to go after it to kill it he ends up shooting a young girl instead .
i 'm not sure what i 'm missing .
i found her unlikable .
i 'm a huge fan of this series , but this book was very , very disappointing .
please do n't fall for the false praise .
is on the cover , and should have stopped me there .
it 's just , a real lame story .
we waited so long for really no answers , no recommending it .
this story is not compelling in any way , but it might have been if written differently .
it 's the least they could do .
why not just yell , " fire ! "
i did n't find it to be that good of a read , with the exception of the last few chapters when the main character is finally figuring things out .
this was a boring read for me .
they were not that dark .
i generally read on even if a book is slow , but i ca n't .
whatever happened to the girl he pushed onto the subway tracks ?
it 's really so cartoonish and ridiculous that it loses any shock value .
maybe it is the real - life pictures instead of art work , i do n't know .
i skimmed the book in order to make myself finish it .
no profanity or sex .
it is not bad , but they promised much more quality to my expectations .
but i just could n't get into a book about mountain climbing , try as i might !
if i had seen the book before i would not have bought it .
there is very little story ( character wise ) and it is totally boring .
a mystery arises - someone is having sex on one of the common area tables and not cleaning up after himself - or herself .
can you guess the climax of the plot ?
okay --- spin around until you throw up .
everyone seems to know what the next person 's going to say and they are just speaking their lines of dialogue on an empty stage .
this , combined with lousy character development , makes for bad art .
i would not recommend this book to my grandchildren .
do not waste your money as i did ! !
this is not a dystopian novel like the jacket cover suggests .
i did not go any further ...
it seems to me she just do n't have the skill she used to have ... it hurts me to leave such a bad review .
as the danger to heroine gets resolved , he is insure if she will continue stay married to him . i could n't get into this book .
i honestly did n't care about what happened to them .
it did nt really flow off the page where your eyes just fly across the page until you do nt realize you are reading .
nothing more to say there . shooting up after being on acid for awhile : people do n't go comparison shopping for drugs .
otherwise , just skip it . brought to you by:*c.s.
it sort of plodded along , for a very long time , and it never hit its stride as far as i was concerned .
this is another book with black - or - white characters , ' perfect ' and totally unlikable heroine , stupid story and far too much flowery prose .
not a particularly good heroine or role model .
where are the women characters ?
please do n't waste your time nor your money .
did this plodding sameness really do it for people ?
he really dropped the ball in this novel , as did his editor who allowed all of the parenthetical asides that interrupted any flow he might have established in the narrative .
maybe it 's the mute thing .
stereotyping like bigotry , can " never " be justified !
it was truly lackluster .
this book is chock full of ridiculous stream - of - consciousness that does absolutely nothing to move the story forward .
story was predictable and it did n't maintain a good momentum .
i kept thinking of her as a little girl instead of a teenager , which made the romance really awkward . yeah ... the romance .
i had already wasted enough time .
i sure wish i had known this was proven a hoax before i read this boring waste of pulp .
however , i am getting so annoyed with several people 's dialog being slammed into a single paragraph that i had to come leave a review .
gets tiresome after a while . some reviews by other readers saying the book is at times self - serving and mean spirited are right on .
the dialogue and language needs work as it is frequently anachronistic - would people of this time really say " gadgets " instead of " instruments " or " devices ? "
but then i just gave up as she continued to pile on the list of people .
this is not a book that is for casual reading .
mostly graphic sex scenes , very little story .
the writing style and story were not my cup of tea .
to try to duplicate that style now is ludicrous .
was this book supposed to be taken seriously by the reader ?
this book is nothing if not just consistently dreadful .
her pair is such an egomaniac with control issues .
it 's like really ?
i have never not finished a book if i have paid money for it , but i just could not make myself finsih this book .
there is no linked index or table of contents .
i could n't even buy the bad guy , who was n't anything more complex than a cartoon character .
okay , this might possibly be a " me " problem , but the format of the book is too difficult for my narrative linear mind to follow .
" frog " , " lizard " , " snake " , and " turtle " stand in for the cold - blooded ones .
did n't anyone notice the repetition and stilted phrasing ?
how and why some of the scenarios came to be was a bit confusing too .
the author 's " notes " are more of the same and can be found in any " new teacher takes on the system " drivel .
it might make sense in the next book , but in this book it felt thrown in and without purpose .
i really was expecting more .
to the author- you can save money by cutting your child 's hair .
just please stop interjecting the psychobabble into a book about waiting tables .
but she was beaten in front of an entire church congregation repeatedly and bitten by snakes multiple times for heaven 's sake .
the amnesia gimmick simply does n't work this time .
pure shame .
i did n't finish the book but i did scan the pages and pretty much came up with the ending .
this broke up both storylines , otherwise i think the book may have been boring .
this series has always been mediocre , as far as paranormal romances go , but this latest book is all flash and no substance .
i thought this book might be a good fantasy read but i found it to be very confusing and actually laughable .
i do n't want to waste time reading about people who persist in irrational or immature behavior just to keep the plot from resolution .
holly , however is a grade a idiot .
writing style is irritating .
this book is very poorly written .
i am utterly flabbergasted by how terribly awful this book is .
the book 's nameless protagonist is completely clueless .
regardless of whatever the message was that the author wanted to get across , she could have done it without going into detail .
not badly written , but not very romantic , either .
" i have nothing to live for " she says .... and who 's fault is that ?
which i knew was there , i just could n't see it .
if you see it for sale somewhere for a dollar or less , buy it .
style ?
this story suffered from too many spelling and other contextual errors unfortunately .
do n't bother with this thing .
i was looking for ideas and wanted to see before and after photos .
unfortunately for me that just was n't the case .
the title was more interesting than the book .
in the end , it was too long .
not even a blush or mention of any qualms or thoughts . ) .
it mostly just gives some anecdotes and details into the press and celebrities .
-- by whom , general ?
maybe it is because of where i live and have had several jobs .
the topography and general situation of the big bend were inaccurate and exaggerated .
my biggest disappointment was the way the book ended .
i picked up this book hoping it would be similar to the stephanie plum series , but this was just boring .
and the conclusion is no conclusion at all .
but in the end , she simply leaves her ; i did n't buy it .
... but i could n't do it , despite purchasing and having read it in its totality .
but the gist is the same .
should i forgive her ?
there was just no passion or some old fashion s e x in this at all .
i found myself skipping over many paragraphs .
there was no spark , or tension between the main characters , and the plot just never had a chance due to the author 's beginner writer errors .
there really was n't much romance in this book , though .
there are no real surprises and the characters make no impression on you .
salt perhaps , but not sea salt .
the writing was poor and disjointed and the story is totally uninteresting .
i prefer books with a little learning involved , and this did not have any .
i know that i myself have a pervasive , horrid and embarrassing propensity to be far less gracious than god is .
it was repetitive ( which i guess is to be expected with the plot and all ) , longwinded , and just plain boring .
i was let down by this collection of stories from one of comics ' most celebrated writers .
" what , that 's it ? "
the audio production however , was pretty awful .
it was short , which would have been okay if it was as stand alone novel as it was reported to be , but it was n't .
i found the " end of time " extremely disappointing particularly after reading the recommendations on the back of the book .
well , for starters it was the most depressing book i 've read in a long time .
this is supposedly a classic ?
i did it !
actually very dumb .
this is a huge waste of time , an improbable story with stereotypes on every page .
there 's nothing better than a big book to fall into .
i was not going to finish it , but i kept thinking something might be resolved .
they just were n't for me .
she is so self - congratulatory and has n't a drop of humility .
he is filling my generation with the most dreadful and unbiblical junk out there .
* * * end spoiler alert * * *
that whole story line was ridiculous .
the " bad guy " all but acquired magic powers in order to carry out his crimes .
even when the next plot point was a fight , escape , or rescue , it was just plain boring .
if i had to guess , he phoned it in , perhaps recycling a previously unpublished novel from his youth .
it was n't even good erotica .
i felt like the later parts were overly stretched .
i really was not invested in the characters so i do n't feel the need to read the next book .
boring , boring , boring with no real story line .
the novel is far too long . the story unfolds largely through flashbacks in the form of old letters .
not " staff " .
she was a bit selfish and forceful and superficial and spoiled .
is total confusion a valid plotline ?
but , i was wrong .
but the biggest problem is the central ethical conundrum .
save your money , this book is not worth your time or money .
not just spelling , grammatical , and continuity errors but also chronological , factual , and historical .
the worst anti - climactic ending i have read in a long time - and then a pointless epilogue stuck on for - i do n't know what for .
i recommend not letting him mess with your portfolio .
after reading the other books in this series , this one fell flat .
a fast read because it contained almost nothing worth thinking about and the writing was boring .
it started out with an interesting idea about a mysterious illness spreading among a group of teenage girls but the story dragged and never could define itself .
disappointed by the time i reached the middle of the story , i still was drawn to finish the book .
it 's okay for a brave character to be scared , but bowel actions ?
the book seems more a rambling of thought rather than something with a story line .
and it just did n't work .
i finally gave up and stopped reading it , which is a shame because it seemed to have some good characters .
and there was nothing else to wonder about .
the plot is sophomoric , but i have read a lot of other , more popular authors who 's are also that bad .
it did not provide me with sufficient information about the range of olive oils available .
if she is an unreliable narrator , this book is not creepy .
despite the flashes of brilliance here and there , they were sooooooo boring .
the only things in the book were reactions to random events .
i ca n't say i 'm sorry i bought it .
it was not satisfying . i also thought that there were provocative possibilities that went unrealized .
the poor long suffering wife did not seem like any woman i have ever known .
i do n't see how this kind of " in your face talk " is going to do anything but cause more trouble .
i ' m disapointed that i spent the money to buy this book .
his more recent statements back off from the praise .
it seemed to lack some of the fire that lj wrote though .
but the books are just not well written .
you knew this pun was coming , so suck it up and deal with it : half bad is just bad .
if the author wanted to make the reader disgusted with sex cannibalism he did a good job .
i liked that the author was trying something new but i just did n't think he went about it the right way for my tastes .
i found myself skimming to just get through it .
believe me , this is but a minimal list .
the heroine was annoying , shallow , not very likable and not well drawn .
it 's hardly worth the money .
this is a spoiler , but ought to be predictable so the reader can make the call about reading this or not .
i 'm sad to say that i actually spent money on this book .
instead , there is lust , desire , possession , fantasies and the like .
feeling sorry for yourself because your dad was n't around during filming a movie , ll that s called work and trying to support your family .
the story as written ca n't be worth much more than 1 1/2 stars .
the characters , for the most part , are flat and uninteresting .
she was the only one who could tell he was so wrong because she could see his talent ( rather like an aura ? )
this book is formulaic and predictable ....
da vinci code was fascinating and i was expecting another good read , but was sorely disappointed .
in fact , you could delete quite a few of them and never notice .
it 's like " sex in the city " on audio .
so i know it 's hard but she could have whined a bit less and tried a bit harder to control her gift .
i really disliked the execution . he did n't walk the bible .
i could not for the life of me get into this book .
the story line as a science fiction based book got too crazy for me .
it has nothing to do with him being a racist , sexist , or overall piece of trash drug user . i read these books , and usually my blood boils .
these sections would have been better served with blank pages .
unfortunately this book does n't deliver .
worst ending of a book i have ever read !
i was left with the conclusion that the author either intended to convey ambivalence towards her subjects , or she truly was ignorant about her condescension .
my hat is off to him for the attempt .
this book was n't worth reading in my free time .
this was lame
and she has no style whatsoever .
i got more than halfway and just gave it up .
it was badly overwritten and disjointed , and i did n't feel very drawn to the characters .
" for such a famous case , the book was quite lackluster , and did not hold my attention .
the story feels rushed , and slapped together .
it was the same old , tired liberal whining .
thank goodness i checked out of a library and did n't spend any money on this book .
i 'm inclined to not recommend this book for that reason .
it was just too far fetched really .
for folks looking for a cogent anti - war argument , you 'll have to look elsewhere .
inconsistent much ?
there were also instances where the same joke was repeated more than once .
by the end of the book , i just did n't take this couple as seriously as i had in the beginning .
so the reading of this book was slow going for me .
gross is synonymous with " dark , depressing and drudgery reading .
i could n't relate to any of them because they had no flaws .
let me give some examples:1 .
i did n't buy this , by the way , my cousin has it and i read it over there .
has difficulty phrasing which leads to oddly disjointed or run .
otherwise , why all this talk about " freedom " and " abundant life " ?
there are no great revelations revealed and the story itself was n't that interesting .
sorry but this series had promise but not with this character at its helm .
instead of a good read , i gave up by midpoint .
in addition , i thought the author often tried too hard to be funny and it fell flat .
overwrought .
it seems as though ll nor the publisher have any respect for the reader as this is an ongoing problem .
this book fails on both counts . the problem with this book is not the author 's political views ; many political extremists wrote excellent history .
that was this book . another thing that bugged me was the narrators gradual evolution to a really , really boring person .
i know , let 's blame everything on the villain 's home environment / indoctrination into wrongdoing .
i did not enjoy it and would not recommend it to anyone .
do n't be a writer .
is he real or not ?
subjects jumped around with no transition or logic .
poorly written , terrible dialogue , and ridiculous story .
i dare you to slog through the rest .
bad plot device .
but some contradictions in a compendium like this are n't a problem . what is a problem in this book is that most of these essays are very poorly written .
this is not it . dr .
i was actually bored reading it , i kept hoping that something new or interesting would happen but the whole book felt like filler .
as a result , there were times i was drawn into the story and times i was bored waiting for it to move forward .
i was hoping she would die .
a good writer would have no problem showing me that .
it seems to me to be very much like a business and not a ministry !
do n't understand the positive reviews at all .
he could n't speak .
this message is profoundly misogynistic .
her book just plain stinks .
we do n't get self - help books to be miserable .
the instructions should be free of errors .
instead of researching , why does n't she just get in touch with herself ?
i found myself skipping over paragraphs because i was n't interested enough to see what was in them .
if i could do it again , i 'd spend my money elsewhere .
what kind of idiot writes this tripe ?
i got bored with the material about halfway through it .
i struggled to slog through to the end hoping a conflict was in there somewhere , but it read more like a diary than a novel .
there is just no meat on the bones , so to speak .
these characters appear shallow because they are n't fully developed .
i imagine it can get tiresome when fans demand more books in a series if the writer is tired of them .
i just could n't get into the story of the butterflies , found the characters uninteresting , and finally quit reading it .
yes the main character goes through some serious stuff , but it 's not the type of stuff i enjoy reading about .
i kept waiting for it to take off and get good , but it never really did .
story line and plot not very well delivered and seemed to drag on going over the same material for chapters an chapters .
while i liked the plot and her characters , i found that the setting left something to be desired .
when i read a true crime story , i want to know everything about the killer and victim , and this gave me nothing .
most of the contents is vague , meandering drivel about leadership which would be of little value to anyone already in the business world .
i had to see it to the end and see if the book redeemed itself .
i did n't find it to be nearly sensual or stimulating enough .
) i wanted to like this book .
it is also not very well written .
there is no competition anymore .
there was a lot of silly in this book and i did not enjoy it .
i found this book pretty average .
it just was n't what i expected and it is disappointing .
in my opinion the sub chapter should be called recommendations and not sources .
i am a huge fan of post - apocalyptic fiction , but i thought this book was goofy .
tedious , messy and confusing are not good words to describe a novel .
for me , she did n't do that .
wow i was bored reading this book .
" what about me ? "
long pages of descriptions and misinformation .
i do n't think that the average fiction reader would ' get it ' nor do i think they would be interested in finishing this book even if they did .
she disliked keeping house , and apparently never did .
there are just so many errors in terminology and concepts .
the author uses constantly uses the annoying phrase " ... a man called ... ) .
would n't recommend for someone looking for a light read .
you think the story line would go further and continue on but it does n't and it left me disappointed .
most characters were very boring . characters introduced , not developed , then dropped .
the author 's writing style was nothing less than " juvenile " .
the guy who stalks her .
someone kills your friends ?
he spoke about his recovery which i know was and is very hard but he indicated in his title this book was about heaven .
honestly , i can not even finish this book .
several improbable plot devices ( esp and and the sperm donor dying of aids ) made even this potentially gripping plot weak .
i wish i had not wasted money on this one .
same syrupy plot , weak characters & too much detail on the mundane .
the character development lacks and his metaphors are obvious .
raped .
all in all , an awful book .
although the concept was good the book needed major editing , thus making this a lackluster read .
it mainly focuses on the changes occurring with your baby , but not self - care or symptom management tips .
i found it only minimally useful .
it was very difficult getting invested in such a vapid shallow character .
- or simply repeating himself .
this is not anything like them .
there are far too many holes in this story and the stories that are completed are so unreal it cheapens the story even more .
in any case , this is also a psychological claim , not philosophical or moral .
had i known that when this book was pitched to me , i would not have reviewed it .
ignorance is no excuse .
it was n't - that 's one of the reasons i was so disappointed in it . it was slow moving and very hard to get into .
the author jumped around too much without much point to the story .
this latest effort lacks substance .
i could n't get into any of them .
the narrator describes his attempt to write a memoir about his separated parents - in - law .
i certainly respect the intent and the knowledge of the author , but this book did n't really impress me .
it was pretty boring for a thriller .
it was unnecessary , excessive , and made no sense in the general arc of the story .
the message i got ( ruthless ambition leading to disaster ) seems trite .
this book was so full of unbelievable scenarios and historically inaccurate themes , i could n't enjoy any of it .
it does not cover basic playing instructions .
light and easy it was and all those pages to build up to such a disappointing ending .
before throwing it in the charity bin i skimmed through the rest to see if something , anything , happened that i would be interested in .
this book reminded me of a poorly written ya book with little to no character development , meager action scenes , and descriptions that lack the slightest spark of inspiration .
i was a little disappointed the book had so much potential especially with that blurb but in the end it did n't live up to it entirely .
i 'm not a big fan of this book , it 's very hard to follow .
but do n't even dream of buying it , either .
the story , which had potential in theory , is just plain lame in execution .
not entertaining or erotic , by my standards .
just saying . so , yeah .
i just could n't seem to care what happened , because i felt like i had read about it all before , but in much more appealing packages .
the hero was hurtful and the heroine barely stood up for herself .
the author has a writing style that , for me personally , i do not enjoy .
okay , i do n't really know what to say about this book .
that 's just not acceptable .
normally , this does n't bother me , but in this case , it caused a chasm in the storyline that left me bored .
i jumped to the end and was n't impressed with the ending .
seriously , tedious .
the writing is beautiful there is no mistaking that , however -- beautiful writing is n't the only thing to keep the reader engaged ...
the poor guy deserves better .
in the end , i simply could n't bear to read the rest of the book .
i just did n't enjoy it at all , in fact , i found myself quite frustrated by the time i finished it .
i had a hard time plodding through the entire story .
mediocrity is not middling talent .
there is far too much time and far too many words devoted to the explanation of why and how the book was compiled .
i did not enjoy this book , it 's bordering on soft porn .
( and a few flops ) i 'd skip this book though if you like most of his works .
i have no doubt that nothing is going to change .
i did n't hate them , i 've read much worse , but they definitely were n't my favorite .
i could forgive all this if the writing had been intriguing , interesting or inspiring ... but it was n't .
the characters are getting bland .
i was attracted to this books cover and thought it might be a great read ... but i was very disapointed ! ! !
and here 's the book main weakness : it produces virtually no evidence to support this claim .
and no advance .
i ca n't stand characters that are this idiotic .
i found myself skimming some and even skipping chapters here and there .
with all her supposed brilliance , why ca n't she think to ask for a new roommate , or join a few clubs ?
there were some new ideas that could have been worked into something readable , but i got flashbacks to previous novels throughout this one .
some of the things she was describing i just had to skip over .
since this is n't easy , most of the time we 're stuck with bias .
i had to re - read several passages while trying to figure out what the author was trying to depict .
and when he returns it 's not for her , it 's for money for his work .
really all and all a disappointment .
thank god i did n't spend money on this terrible book .
there are some interesting ideas and concepts but none of them are executed or explored properly .
the observations were off - base .
might work as a sleeping aid but trust me , a pill is cheaper .
it 's not unreadable , and i was able to finish it .
i did not feel that there was much of a story line .
i most certainly hated the ending .
this would have made an interesting read but this book .
i did n't like that at all , especially the way his death was handled in the written description .
as others have rightly noted , the " science " in this book is simply horrible and there are many with his comments concerning classical music .
i guess i should have read into it more , but i wanted the book based on the movie , not a graphic novel .
unfortunately , that is hardly news .
i could n't figure out what this book is about .
this is far too small for the pictures to have the necessary impact , and much of the text is far too small to comfortably read .
anyway , i struggled even to finish this book and found it ultimately unsatisfying and really very boring .
the font would not change .
i 'm fighting my way thru this but am disappointed .
it 's ok i suppose but have read better
i prefer not to read a lot of cursing .
who would act like this ?
using vampires and having them be involved on him being crucified ... interesting ... thought not interesting enough to keep me reading .
i did n't even like saying those words .
i do n't pick books at random otherwise .
heavens , but some people have a gift for flogging a dead whore .
i was very disappointed in this meg 's story .
that it 's merely ' bad ' in a field that 's predominantly awful really is n't an excuse to support it , though .
the author does not like people much , at least he does not like his characters .
in this book the authors skimmed over the details in order to make the actions fast paced , but after a while that gets old .
the author seems completely unattached .
the torture - not really .
the book was , frankly , both boring and depressing .
so juvenile !
i know that some of it is supposed to be comical but as far as my taste goes , the author stretches it too far .
it was ok . just ok . as an adult , reading about the world of a teen normally is the setting for a coming of age book .
i really hoped this would be an interesting read ..... not !
whom i have no desire to be part of .
there are way too many excellent mystery authors out there to waste time on this one .
the advice her puritanical father gave them before they married was just about the only thing that made sense in this book .
entirely too transparent a plot , too much telling , plot exposition in dialog and unlikeable characters team up to make me a sad panda indeed .
i skimmed a lot of the dialogue because it was n't necessary to read it -- the end result of the conversation would be nice .
it 's not worth the time or effort .
thought it would be better .
i do n't generally skip , while i 'm reading , but i began to skip those passages altogether .
this is a lazy - if not contemptuous ( of the reader ) - way to reveal information , although the demands of a screenplay may dictate such shortcuts .
the characters were relatable enough , but the predictable plot never really went anywhere
in other words , the author is elitist .
being a public librarian myself , i felt this was such a gross inaccuracy of our profession .
what happened with all the pregnant women , are their babies ok ?
subsequently i did n't care too much when characters started dying .
not worth reading , let along paying good money for .
etc -- many more similarities but i do n't want to write a spoiler .
in the beginning of the book it jumped around from character to character and found myself very confused , not really knowing who was who and what was going on .
this left me , and probably many reader , with their heads spinning while trying to figure out what the point was .
i 'd hate to have her as my only friend .
it 's like the author got into it and found the info she had was n't sufficient for an entire book so did research and filled in with nonsense .
not really a police procedural but more of a novel about personal self - discovery the work suffers from too much self - absorbed introspection and not enough action .
but this one made me a little bit disappointed .
this book repeats the same information over and over and over and over until it fills all the pages .
the small references that are there do not actually talk about the topic .
i would n't read another book by this author if you paid me the writing was predictable and amateur .
it is not realistic to me that such a character would not also be deeply concerned about racial justice .
it leaves me , more to be desired .
either way , this book was not my favorite .
cults ?
if it looks ridiculous then ridicule it . there 's a problem with that approach .
this comment concerns only physical abuse by women who lack empathy .
this book ( ... ) certainly was n't worth the cover price .
if you do n't like that type of thing , skip this book .
i 'd say i was crazy but too many people have already posted what i was thinking .
because it would n't . "
the storyline took way to long to develop .
appeared the author was looking to fill pages .
he elsewhere argued that science and naturalism are in conflict by assuming a new definition of naturalism .
not a complete waste of time but really could never figure out where the story was going .
not only were the details a mess but after a while even the characters began to get annoying .
it 's just not what i was looking for .. maybe for those who like the designs .
the writer is a moron .
i tried to finish this book , really .
the resolutions are unsatisfying and contrived .
none of this comes through .
i do n't read romance novels because i want to read about stupid , plain , overweight people .
but in this one she sleeps with his brother ? ? ? ?
the plot is interesting enough in theory but the execution was n't very strong .
that 's not how people 's mind work , even selfish teenagers with high self aware do n't express themselves like that .
i could n't knowingly subject another person to such terrible writing .
again , he says it bothers him that he 's deceiving her but he does n't really try to mitigate the damage he 's causing .
too obvious to be funny . then , i just did n't find i related to or liked any of the characters .
the only reason i even bothered to buy the book was because of the all the glowing reviews .
i have no idea why this book got so much hype .
or were his wife and baby a figment of her imagination too ?
the killing of dogs left me with nightmares .
but this book is just wretched .
but enough of a backstory is given here , that we can pretty much predict how these folks vote .
maybe it was an artistic departure that she thought she was well due ... maybe it was a fantasy escapade ?
there was no plot , no character development and , seemingly , no point to this book .
as a statistician i found most of his arguments superficial , blatantly incorrect , or misleading .
but to have jeans and a short sleeve shirt seem odd to her , is again stereotypical .
but i believe this book has a deceptive title and has dumbed down the definition of best seller to an all time low .
and why did the result of that interview convince her to leave school ?
nothing is in order .
if the satire is the point , it 's too scattershot and underdeveloped .
i did n't really understand the need to place both those retellings within the book .
the advice you get is comparable to what you might learn talking to your friends -- not bad , but not necessarily material for a book .
but , as the pages turned , the accumulation of errors grew .
he is cold and hard and if i was ella i 'd have punched him on multiple occasions .
i was lost in this book and never quite got it .
i am very disappointed in this book .
that is not a good thing .
this book has nothing to do with innovation !
there were many fragmented sentences that broke the flow .
if so , that was not clear enough .
why do authors think phrasing like that is sexy or attractive ?
rather confused as to why this author is so popular .
why oh why would these parents feel the need to clear their name before putting those efforts into finding their daughter 's killer ?
rambled all over the place with no real point to the story .
the repetitive flow to this story is torturous .
let 's start with the plot 's premise in explaining the book 's weaknesses .
the author just started .... rambling .
i was totally turned off .
the charecters are soulless and pretty boring even when compared solely to the other books in the series .
before i got to that page , i was like , ok , this could be a good springboard for parents to discuss these things with their children .
not much to this one . the writing and names were annoying .
not just her super power .
this book was such a waste of money .
ca n't really be bothered with the next in the series unfortunately .
it just went on and on and on like that little pink rabbit about nothing .
! it felt like it was written by someone else ; it had so many mistakes and holes in the plot .
he was bad because he stole some books ?
after that , he 's free to just kill most of the rest of the bad guys , you know , just kind of walk up and shoot them .
the quality is horrible .
these people would never buy his , they are only posting in an attempt to prevent others from buying it .
the plot is simplistic and overly melodramatic and the heroine seems to have no appealing traits or even a true personality .
not only did she nearly become a victim of the same idiot again , but he could easily have taken taken the broken glass from her hand and killed her .
it did not delve into why or how the other teenagers got into that kind of mess .
( that happened here , too ) .
the writer does nothing to make you care about them or what happens to them .
" wacky liberal ideas are left unexamined . severely disappointing and fairly unreadable .
the bottom line is this : there is no invasion .
it was just impossible to believe their relationship .
could not recomend to any one .
simply not up to his usual standard .
i have used physical corrections .
navigating many pages of odd and disconnected circumstances had me hoping for the end of this story .
if a child has not seen the movies the quotes mean nothing and the moving blobs mean even less .
unfortunately the book is quite predictable .
if the author was honest with her readers or at least make the main character a bit ambiguous then the novel might be enjoyable .
i really wanted to stop reading , but i do n't like to quit just in case it gets better ..... but it did n't .
the book had a crappy opening , an ok middle , and an end that moved way too fast and not enough explanation .
i feel like the book moved slow , and like the characters did n't develop quite as deeply as i 'd like .
tedious details and repetition made for slow going through most of the story .
unfortunately , i found the book tiresome and slow .
my husband asked me why i did n't just quit reading it .
it has been a long time that i was not able to finish a book , disappointed with a kiss for a nickel .
it could have been such a great read , but in the end , it was a major let down . the plot is pretty simple .
it 's not great but it 's not egregiously awful and there 's a time and a place for those kind of big quest and elf books .
) , typos and grammar issues should have been corrected . the main character was also inconsistent .
dreamer repeats herself and the same ideas over and over again .
it was just an odd book ... very creepy at times but then huge amounts of blather and babble that completely deserted the thread of the story .
i , too , was a bit disappointed with this book .
that is a weak excuse to get herself into trouble when her ex - lover is much more capable and experienced at solving mysteries .
now i have and i feel like reading it was a total waste of time .
quotes in the book were taken out of context and i found nothing of any real value .
and that is too bad .
boring and predictable .
he was just a foolish old man who did n't have anything better to do than to torment an unsuspecting young anthropologist .
the biggest mystery here is : how did this tripe get published ?
if so , it 's just another idea that 's been done before and better .
instead , the endless parade of marching phrases , separated from one another by commas and semicolons -- so that the punctuation becomes another character ?
the main characters lacked the animalistic passion that is inherent to the changeling books that have come before and as a result , i was left feeling unsatisfied and somewhat annoyed .
or other such pithy refutations of the main premise of the video as i argued against it as i watched it .
save yourself the time and money and do n't bother to read these books .
they lost and all their subsequent kind have lost too .
gaps in the dialogue ( which the reader must fill in ) , logic jumps , and a contorted plot that beggars the imagination .
but as far as a " literary thriller , " this book does n't fly .
people were horrified when her parents concieved her for that purpose .
the story was n't written in a particularly interesting way .
this book was not what i expected , there was n't much of a plot , the characters were everywhere .
in fact , implausible story endings seem to be a specialty .
i 'm not looking for constant action .
this is just a higher class version . i think i am not recommending this one .
you can not say such a contemptible thing in a book and just let it slide .
there are hyphens in so many bad places , and words that are omitted from sentences all over the place .
seriously , she could n't have saved herself from a freaking paper bag , she was so pathetic . the story did n't make a whole lot of sense .
i was wrong - the book contains incorrect historical information , outdated restaurant and hotel info , and generally does n't contain anything that you could n't find easily online .
however , practitioners and those seeking more detailed pictures for technique will be greatly disappointed .
too much right wing trash .
sorry , but my imagination just can not stretch that far and then snap back to happily ever after .
the story has an original premise , but beyond that was not very clever .
how come the white people just did n't " get over it " and " accept the inevitable " ?
the prose is excellent , but there is far too much of it , with far too little to say .
it was depressing and jumped around too much .
but i do n't have any recollection of ever being god .
however there are things that are not mentioned in the book that really need to be .
'cause it sure ai n't the impression i 've been getting of her .
but i have been extremely disappointed .
the narrative is mostly half to full - page paragraphs .
the villains are equally too bad , too evil .
overall , a disappointing book , one that i really did n't enjoy .
there are no chapters and just small breaks that let you know that the writer has moved onto a new unrelated and unnamed topic .
it is not so much the story premise that fails here , but rather the execution .
it is just the same garbage in a different package .
i know i am in the minority here , but to me this book was just one long plodding book .
however , i found it so boring i could hardly pay attention .
it was mostly street names which i found confusing and unnecessary
no help from this book .
the only redeeming quality of the book was the ending .
most of the drug - taking episodes are ridiculously exaggerated .
terrible , repetitive writing .
to me , it seemed as if the author was more intent on creating quirky , off - the - wall characters than in telling a good story .
about some kind of mutant children .
this is really annoying and childish .
exposition , after exposition , after exposition ..... oh god .
too bad , but i am one that wo n't pick up another of her novels nor recommend it .
it is a quick read , so not much time is wasted on it if you hate the ending .
did the author forget to write the ending ?
please do n't call me again .
i could n't bring myself to care about any of the characters in the book .
they have flashes where hanging out with them is interesting but by and large they just do n't move .
but if the author was aiming for a younger reader - like middle school - what 's with all the foul language and sexual situations ?
a disappointment !
the writer seems to be totally spaced out and has no material to work with .
i 've got to be honest , i have not read the book , but the title is deceiving just based off what i just wrote .
again , enough already . brown perhaps gathered too much travelogue and historical information for this book .
not being a writer , i was impressed .
the reason i like his books is because ... well , they 're all the same . i do n't mean his writing style , his characters .
this makes no sense and appears to happen solely because of plot convenience , not because it is what would naturally happen .
is n't he possessive ? ?
i read a lot and just was not impressed with it .
at the end , i was disappointed and left cold .
she stupidly says " we are not married . "
there was nothing " romantic " about this story .
there is no real content here people .
in light of past adventures , the story does not fair well .
i find it very difficult to leave poor reviews on books .
it 's hard to believe she would be so stupid in her decision making .
this book took much longer to get through than is typical for me , because i 'd lose interest and have to almost force myself to continue .
i mean , wtf ? ?
but i 'm sure someone said it to him .
but they ca n't , no matter what some fiction writer says .
i was so very wrong with this purchase .
they were n't just filler , they were fodder !
this book did not say it was used , however appears to be used .
i wish i could return it ... not worth the read .
some sentences read like ' the guy was attacked .
frankly , it read like a horrible junior high school text book .
nothing really fit together for me .
the patrons would rise up against a smoker . typical legal / law enforcement stereotypes .
not only does the action completely skips over the action , but we do n't get any information about what happened .
it became boring and tedious , as other reviewers have remarked .
why is the narrators voice so defensive ?
it was not worth buying the books for this pre - prologue .
you did n't write an ending .
it 's not a dream .
wasted opportunity all around .
but i think that with this book , she might be resting on her laurels .
they did n't talk to each other so much as try to outdo each other 's metaphors .
and so boring .
--- that would demand too much .
but the characters are lacking .
this book has simply become a pathetic relic of a bygone era , useful only as an object of sarcastic mockery and derision .
this is not a thriller .
it 's not worth buying and definitely not something you 'd want your kids reading .
the dialogue was a labor to read through .
this effort brings in too much extraneous information in an attempt to accomplish that goal and is an utter failure .
no doubt the author learned a lot about himself too , but in the end he seems to retain his immense dread of death .
i tried to drag myself through , but i could not .
it was not very interesting and i usually enjoy books of this subject normally .
there 's nothing here that some author has n't done somewhere else , and better .
there were glaring mistakes in the narrative that ruined its flow .
the concept was interesting if not entirely new , but a lot of the book was cliched , awkward , and contrived to work the unnecessary love triangle into the plot .
i do n't mind birds , but this was way too much and too in depth .
the angles were endless , but as i mentioned , this novel fell far short of what it could 've been .
but he does not , draw your own conclusions .
the author is trying hard and appears as if she 's been to too many writer 's workshop .
? i did manage , however , to find a couple of useful tidbits of information i had not run across before , which explains my 2-star rating .
i was hoping for better and now am not sure i want to investigate the alphabet any further .
anytime someone ate , the meal was invariably described as not just unappetizing , but as downright revolting !
she even assigns value judgments to women , dividing them as " average , " " above average " and " below average " in god 's kingdom .
after reading the flaps of several of them , i settled on this one , solely because it looked like it would be the most ridiculous .
even then , i would prefer more theory and understanding and fewer recipes . the kindle edition has some bizarre formatting glitches , but nothing too bad .
and the constant sex ..
at this point it was impossible to stretch credulity - the sham marriage was completely out of order and in no way legal but they seemed to think it was .
this may be insensitive , but it 's so freakin ' juvenile , i just ca n't get past it .
this book lacks both .
the wife - pixie character q lacks definition ; she seems a shadow alter ego there to reinforce his impressions .
not a good use of money .
why keep wasting the time and money , after all ?
space geeks will find it maddeningly simplified and sorely lacking in technical understanding , and need not bother reading it .
if the author does n't care anymore -- why should we ? ?
he did n't really seem to have a focus .
nothing about this book stands out .
and a knack for taking advantage of spiritual tourism and spiritual tourists who are looking to get something for nothing . very disappointing .
if you did n't need this book as a setup for the next one then i would say skip it .
there is no plot in this book and very little substance .
they are also too hard to tell apart and fail to hold my interest .
the storyline limped along .
i do n't read him unless i am desperate for something to read .
this plot line never quite makes it .
there is an apparent agenda to promote the use of drones instead of a balanced review of benefits and limitations .
you get the impression that doctors and nurses are incompetent degenerates .
i find this disappointing especially after her daughter just came out with a book about how her life forever changed when she got pregnant as a young girl .
the pacing of the story was too slow for me as well .
the story does n't develop traction immediately because the author fails to establish a protagonist in the early chapters .
the battle seems like an attempt to inject some action ( this device is repeated in later books ) .
it strikes me that something dishonest is going on here , and we are not really looking at the big picture .
i could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand .
but i will not be buying any other books in this series .
there is much to recommend in this book that i enjoyed reading . however , i found the author 's writing style labored and difficult .
this was soooo not what i was expecting !
i was expecting some realism but did not find it in this book .
this was a bad book choice for me .
she was n't cute and kind of dim , she was just dumb .
however , the plot is obvious and predictable , the characters unbelievable , and the story too long .
this reads more like a textbook , with data overload , stilted language and unconvincing scenes .
it is a shame when a good writer sells out for a potential movie .
unfortunately , he chose to use a bag of tricks instead .
i have read several books on that topic lately , but what is exceptional about this one is the total lack of scholarship .
that is totally preposterous .
she said nothing .
palmer should stop writing now before her writing gets worse .
the formula that he sticks to is now stale .
i 'll bet many of these verbose reviews are no different .
but as i continued to read , i started to feel like she really deserved crappy boyfriends for being so damn stupid .
from the synopsis , it seemed that it could be an interesting story , but it was just plain boring .
this reader , however , was unimpressed and unmoved .
that 's what should have happened .
it 's been building up over the last few books , so this was n't a surprise .
all the characters were extremely shallow -- hello , character development please .
he seduces the poor girl , gets her pregnant , and when she wants to marry another to provide for the unborn child , all hell breaks loose .
( that 's a different method , not merely a typo . )
i have liked the previous books well enough , but this one just went on too long and kept adding too much .
i would read something else from the author just to give him another chance to see if he really is that snobby and self - absorbed of a person .
this , however , did n't work for me personally .
the exposition is extremely heavy handed .
the book simply does n't offer any backstory or incentive to care about its bland characters .
and i do n't really touch the arrogant way it is written .
it seems as if each book changes or contradicts something that happened in a previous story .
i hate to torture someone else with them but i refuse to burn even the worst of books .
this book does not offer enough detail to be considered * * * * * .
he is entitled to his opinion , no matter how wrong it is .
i found it predictable and not very interesting .
oh , except for the conservative ones who are utterly virtuous .
it is not just town lore but a fact .
do n't waste your time or your brain cells on this one .
unfortunately this book was terrible .
nothing was really happening , i even skipped ahead to the epilogue and that was even the same !
" not a good introduction to this author .
too much introspection and wallowing in self pity to be likable .
not even entertaining sad really ...... what next ? ? ?
worst of all , the plot was beyond predictable .
i wo n't even discuss the storyline as there was none .
while it was an engaging read , this book fell a little flat for me .
i decided not to waste any more time on a book i disliked .
it appeared to have little effort put into it and was just written to cash in .
i wanted this to be better , and it could have been better .
i just did n't care . i know there are a lot of people that love this book .
it is really not about the poker bride .
from my old , apparently liberal , history textbooks
and that is the exact point when i got up and threw the book in the trash .
the author pours in so many unnecessary generalized ingredients which lack detail and flavor .
i just do n't see how he can do that if he 's as whacked as it was let on in the book . last but not by any means least .
the female lead has no backbone and repeats herself over and over .
why is so offensive to so many writers on addiction to label addiction a disease ?
i wish there had been something redeeming here , but this is just a total " miss " for me .
so , i have hopes for redemption on behalf of this duo .
there was also times i did n't understand as well as things that totally had nothing to do with the story .
but as it happens time and time and time and time and time and time again , it becomes tiresome .
this book was long winded drawn out and down right boring .
i guess like the saying goes , " do n't judge a book by it 's cover "
i guess i should n't have expected too much , but i still hate wasting the money .
i did n't warm to any of the characters because none of them seemed to have any depth to them .
it can not be that bad .
it is boring , repetitive , and has no story .
the characters seem to lack motivation , and their actions often are n't cohesive .
had some interesting ideas but none of them really went anywhere .
" unfortunately , those exploding hearts were not fatal .
this book was a huge disappointment !
while she might be saving the world , would n't she think " once is enough " and decide against it ?
she was whiney and pathetic , as well as devious and mean .
i have read better and i have read worse .
no other non - police character has appeared .
the book also suffers from a serious lack of editing .
it would represent instead our idea of consciousness .
even if the patient does want a relationship with a psychiatrist , in no way is it acceptable for the psychiatrist to act on it .
but unlike his other books , the formula here seems very watered - down and bland .
it 's not even a book !
i kept waiting for it to get good and to me it never did , the ending was incomplete , so i 'm done trying .
becomes boring after some time !
although the book is interestingly written , i just could n't take the jumping around from one thought to another and trying to keep it all straight .
i found myself bored to death .
the dialogue is dull and ridiculous , and after a few chapters , i could n't have cared less about any of the characters or the storyline itself .
i could drum up no interest whatever in his stories or his characters .
what i i truly can not figure out , is why this book is so popular ? ? ? ?
if their intent was to make it understandable and interesting , they failed miserably .
i sure hope not , because that stuff was really awful .
in other words their points contradicted each other even though they were talking about the same culture at the same time in history .
unlike other audio books , some quite complex , i could n't follow what the author was talking about .
i found myself screaming out aloud ' just get on with it , for pity 's sake ! '
thank heavens i got the book from the library and did n't waste a dime on it !
the description of their coming together is supposed to be an unbelievable and almost cataclysmic encounter .
the author 's tone is so arrogant the book is difficult to read .
) this book description is nothing but a plain lie .
so i was disappointed that i could n't even finish this one as it lacked the flow and interest of the hunger games .
this book seemed a bit drawn out .
this book sounds much better than it is .
i stopped at about the middle , which is something i never do .
shame on the authors , this was way off the mark !
i felt nothing for either of them .
yes , the sex is with vampires , werewolves , etc . , but , again , " parts is parts . "
thank god , this is a meaningless accolade because if it were true then we would be living in a shallow world indeed .
i liked the premise behind the book , however it was poorly written and i had a hard time getting into it .
the book is so boring and it drags on and on .
i mean a book written by a child .
oh , i 'm sorry ... ritual chanting .
to be quite honest , i was bored .
she 's a flat character and i never felt like i knew much about her .
i have to call it pretentious and overdone .
the story line is vague & confusing & the writing is belabored & boring .
i also agree with the earlier review that the ending felt really rushed .
this book was boring to me .
maybe all romance novels are like this ?
i was very into this book , however , i think the book went south towards the end .
which would probably be okay , except it would be nice to see a discussion on timing the entry .
i did not like this particular book .
i would n't have bought it for myself unless it was in a discount bin .
no . these kids never do anything .
she is silly and smart , annoying and enlightening .
the writing is painful , the main character is horrible , and the overall story is just bad .
to each their own , but i found the writing very childlike , repetitive , and boring .
if anything , he 's gotten worse .
this book could have been a great force to get kids interested in modern paleontology , but instead goes for cheap ratings among the sexually frustrated crowd .
it seemed like the author completely ran out of ideas or just hit the required amount of pages promised to the publisher and just abruptly ended it .
it is very difficult to keep the interest in this reading .
i 've seen such glowing reviews of this book and while it was promising , i just expected something different .
reading nearly to the middle of the great story and completely killed the whole story ... sorry but it is bad review for a beautiful story .
this was a bad book , in so many ways .
i 'm sure the story is interesting but i just ca n't get past the painfully slow pace and the sophomoric writing .
this book crushed that notion .
it is a below average work .
instead she makes me frustrated ; bored , even .
neither were scratched or anything .
the romance is dull - witted , at best .
it 's that it was pointless . i kept reading , hoping that at some point this would all come to something .
a ridiculously horrible display of poor writing .
i did not like the writing , the characters , or the plot .
he is arrogant , demanding , abusive , and an all - round uneven kind of guy .
it offered no closure on several of the plots and subplots that were laid out .
the new publishing gold rush seems to be to pseudo - scientific books that " simplify " complex subjects .
this one however is just not that engaging or thought provoking .
she also misses the irony in her criticism of the wealthy couple , when she wrongly believes herself ' unconcerned ' with status and wealth .
in a word ... boring .
mostly it felt strained .
this is not a well - written book , mainly because the dialogues are forced .
i found it to be more annoying than anything else .
this is a hard review to write .
it even sounds silly writing it .
they were stuck together and hard to separate .
nothing special , nothing unique .
however , this book lacks charm and originality , unlike many of those old movies .
she does n't trust that he 's not infected .
it was too vague and seemed to skip around .
i believe that the book is of limited value .
the title is misleading and i will not buy anymore of his products .
it is all too ridiculous !
yeah , that was totally slut shaming and uncalled for .
poor in terms of quality of photographs , terrible editing , and , most of all , for allowing most of the content to be printed at all .
had to give up reading as it is n't the of language i 'm used to , same goes for plot .
i can see why it might , but i just did n't find either character compelling enough .
she 's rude , cocky , gossipy , and downright mean !
i think she made a huge mistake .
the premise was good and i liked the idea of the murder club but somehow it just was n't for me .
it really only needed to be mentioned once , especially if it was going to be dragged out for so long .
the journey towards self awareness and shedding limitations is a time honored theme , but endless made up scenes and trials and tribulations get tedious .
there was no reason for them to be together or not be together and there was no sexual tension which is one of the best parts .
how can you be a successful attorney ( and former public defender ) and be so incredibly naive ?
does this book suck or what ?
is n't that just adorable ?
the author makes it " okay " to giggle because , afterall , these people were " stupid .
it was slow , and dragged on and on ... i finished it to see how it ends ... and like the rest of the book , it was disappointing .
however , that does not mean that reason plays less of a role now than then .
very long winded , as another reviewer stated , and i agree completely .
the plot does n't make sense !
too much description of sex .
however , the book 's poor organization vitally detracts from its effectiveness .
i personally do n't like it when books have just enough stuff that is real that i ca n't tell what 's fake .
the story was n't as strong although i liked the character development .
but , what was a let down was that in previous books there was a definite tie to the major characters that was missing in this book .
do nt believe the hype regarding this book .
tried twice to read this book ( on tape ) and am giving it up as not worth the effort .
this book was too much of a downer .
overall , i was not impressed with this novel .
i thought it was a little dry .
and " what purpose does [ this book or that book ] serve ?
this is not the case with this book .
i really tried to make myself read it , but why , i am not sure .
i liked a lot of her other books but this one seemed to drag on and i kept waiting for something to happen .
any time a guy is saying things like " do n't scream at me , ok ? "
his sole purpose in the book seemed to be to be constantly hungry in order to elicit wry laughs from the rest of the group .
but it all comes to naught when the code is fraught with errors .
it compels you to read along and to avoid your life in order to continue with it , but ... the ending was just .. nothing .
contrary to other " low - score " reviewers here , i actually did like the main characters .
you like to be bored silly .
i tried this diet and it was awful .
i guess the novel is set in some strange alternate historical past , because there were lots of odd references .
the characters are flat , there is no build up of the plot and every happening in the story is thrown at the reader in the most clunky way possible .
this is a rather moody piece , although not so depressing you&#8217;ll have trouble reading on .
it 's a rich , having - nothing - better - to - do people 's game .
i might read something else by him , but instead of paying for it , i might get it from the library .
i do not understand the good reviews for this book .
just ridiculous , this is a high school girls read , i ca n't believe i wasted the time i did to read this junk .
the book was very hard to get through .
i did n't find much humor in it .
tedious even .
it was a lame attempt at humor and storytelling .
the editor puts down all the major writers to the point that i have to write this review .
i was not surprised , but it did overwhelm me .
almost in a childish way .
this is unfortunately her undoing as well .
the book seems to be about women getting pregnant , not getting pregnant and having babies .
neither is successful .
that said , if you take to book as a novel , it is not a bad read .
gates spends his time in self adulation .
the ending felt too rushed and out of sync with the rest of the book .
my husband and i read this book for a couples book group and both agreed it was a deep disappointment and a complete waste of time and money .
it bored me in parts , made me not care in others and then want to throw my kindle away for reading such nonsense in the end .
we badly need a comprehensive objective of this major author and opinion - maker .
some may enjoy it , but i ca n't say that i did sorry .
i kept reading in hopes that something would happen , but as i turned pages , i knew what would happen .
so frustrated that i did not finish .
ironically , the trees cut down to print this book could have been much better served .
not much actually happens here .
one can not legitimately cast historical accounts into the trash bin on " general considerations .
this " woman " does n't know anything worthy of being placed in a book .
that 's good advice , but there 's nothing radical about it .
the concept is n't bad and the plot moves along well , but the characters just are n't real .
this was such a stupid book .
this is not a bad book .
but this one did n't cut it .
additionally , i read this on the kindle , so i did n't realize i was at the end of the book until i got to the acknowledgements page .
essentially blackmail .
for no real purpose .
my book club selected this book ; i would not recommend it to others .
the part that scorched me , however , was that it did n't really end .
the author writes good erotic scenes but nothing else .
the story was not very interesting .
i found this book densely written , boring and of no practical value .
very poor explanation and no examples at all .
very shallow and unimaginative .
at best they present over - used cliches , at worst they are tedious beyond belief .
unfortunately ... he does n't .
was n't realistic .
the sickening abuse that the hero had suffered , and continued to suffer , made him seem pitiable rather than sexy .
the authors do n't say , just " puppies bark " .
otherwise , do n't waste your time on this disappointing novel .
a lot of reviewers complained about the repetitive detailed cave descriptions .
unlike his other books the story line was not interesting nor did i connect with any of the characters .
i 'm bored by it .
unfortunately , judging by the other reviews of this product i am not alone .
i did n't like any of the characters or the story line .
while the point 's themselves may be interesting , the word choice lulled me to sleep on several occasions .
the basic story line was not a problem .
all the stupid exchanges with his wife / partner got a little old .
was disappointed and did n't read the book at all .
the ideas in the book i found interesting , but that could not make me forgot about how it was written .
unfortunately she does n't come close to his level .
this seemed like a bunch of rambling , incoherent nonsense !
previously you were n't supposed to let your baby fall asleep at the breast .
the problem is , they did n't .
i could not get into it , especially after his other books focused on the world of corporate finance .
this is a mediocre book whose writing does n't live up to the promise of the storyline .
his dialogue is weak and the story progression is predictable .
there is no supposedly about it .
i honestly found it to be a little creepy .
did i mention the ' too stupid to live ' actions of these characters ?
it felt maybe a little too hip or self - conscious .
not enough spice for me to fall in love with the main couple .
" i ran as fast as i could , which apparently was pretty fast .
as it stands , this is not a good cliffhanger it is just a waste of time where you get to know a couple characters and there is no resolution .
she created a diversion seemingly for no reason , and maybe i misread , but it seemed to me like they could 've tried to both get away to safety .
so much potential and imagination .
i ended up returning the book .
even most revisionist historians have given up flogging that particular dead horse .
he just seems like the most disinterested character .
my recommendation to you would be not to waste your time with it .
there is no reason for this to happen to a coloring book other than the paper being low quality .
there really is no new story left in the world .
then there was a rather unbelievable bank robbery and a farfetched sniper barrage .
none of the stories left me with any sort of satisfaction for reading them , curious what else there might be to the story or offering any sort of life lesson .
but women should n't joke in general ?
the book for me felt like a walk ... just something to pad the author 's writing resume and wallet , nothing more .
this has to be the worst book ever written .
the predicaments in which these characters find themselves become so implausible that readers like me laugh and cheer when they escape , as expected , from every peril .
but certainly not this kind .
is that this author 's idea of what a long lasting commitment should be based on ?
there was no explicit sex or gore .
perhaps what is worse is that he is not a fair and objective reporter .
such a disappointing ending for such a promising , interesting book .
there are plenty of other authors out there who write about the same type of material , and their books are a lot more reasonably priced .
his mother : " so pants were off ? " ) .
the sex is overdone , and quite boring at this point .
but is not the author to validate ?
please do n't call this tv movie script " literature . "
this book is overpriced for the quality of construction .
it grants that there is no concrete evidence , but whispers about it anyhow . i gave this book to goodwill and went looking for something more factual and less vacuous .
if he only did it lightly as a prelude to sex i could see that .
she herself seems to be an afterthought .
this book could have been so much better if she did n't talk the way she does .
to put it bluntly , this author is anti - homeschooling .
page after page of pointless brutality and sophomoric banality .
i advise not buying this " lack of instruction book " when there are so many good ones out there !
she simply jumps from literature to literature as she takes the reader on a merry ride .
i believe the author could not find enough to write about , which i thought was unusual considering her topic of interest .
the scenes from the past were weird and self - indulgent .
what woman would stay with a man like this , especially after she becomes pregnant and he wants nothing to do with her or the baby .
not because of a lack - of - detail .
you do n't talk about this evil mother when she 's never done much of anything wrong .
i was not impressed in this book .
the characters were all so depressed and troubled .
this book sucks , big time .
the book seemed like she was just trying to end it and get that checked off her to do list .
another was the stale death takes a holiday concept .
pass on this book- it 's not worth your time or money !
however , the worst part of the book is the conversations between the characters which borders on laughable , not for the content but for the context .
but if you 're wanting a story that 'll scare the pants off you , do n't bother ; this book wo n't do that .
i did n't want to turn the next page because i did n't want to know what happened .
overall , skip this one .
i think he showed his emotions well but the overall conclusion and story just fell flat .
i did n't really believe the ending ( which i wo n't give away ) but i could see where it was going .
unfortunately that is not allowed .
otherwise do n't bother . it is n't a guide to being made over , or to much of anything really .
i do not need to ask them .
there is some pretty cool imagery in this book , but if you are looking for something fast paced , or even remotely exciting do n't look here .
not sure why i ordered this and i will pass it on to a used book store .
the characters were typical yet it did n't seem like the author knew her characters .
there were long slogs where the story just became inert because of the talky nature .
they should be killed last " ) .
that her life changed for the better is not really explored .
the description of this book really intrigued me , but i found it disappointing .
he 's barely used in the movie and when he is , he 's not funny .
at times , it almost sounded like that was the intent .
the publisher ?
unrealistic characters , predictable beyond belief , and not compelling at all .
i went into this book hoping for something that would be easy to read and inspiring but also attainable and at an average person 's level .
there is obviously no connection .
ultimately i could n't recommend this book .
turn of the century is so boring and slow moving that it 's not worth reading .
i found the style awkward and was not impressed by the characters , or the plot as it turns out .
this book is terrible and i ca n't understand why so many parents think it is so great ! ! !
it 's just a really weird book .
this was the most boring book i have read in a very long time- i had trouble getting through it .
unfortunately , the story is n't enough to make me read the next one .
but is it really her diary ?
) .this book just dragged on and on and on , but i stuck it out because i kept hoping it would redeem itself - unfortunately it never did .
the assistant 's actions seem very sloppy to say the least .
i 'm merely going to comment on the fact that this book is n't particularly accurate in terms of historical content .
this happens with scenes and action , too .
while the book covered these topics , it was n't with the depth or gravity that i had hoped for .
an inaccurate yet sensational " history " this is what happens when a novelist tries to do history and cause sensation with an ulterior motive .
they have lustful beach sex and he is torn between his old wife and hot clone ( yes , it is that silly ) .
i no longer purchase his books but get them from the library so as to cut down on my monetary disappointment .
it is not the type of book i enjoy .
i just wanted her to be a bit more secure and sure of herself .
she has no degree and has not graduated from any college .
nothing leads one to believe she ever anything more than a clingy , needy sheltered rich girl .
it was n't just the lack of romance between the characters , but the story was so dry and predictable .
please delete .
and even though i skipped a chunk i really do n't feel i missed any of the story ... that 's a problem .
i ca n't say that this book was poorly written , because it was n't .
while a most enjoyable read , i must agree with other reviewers that this book fails , but for yet more reasons .
, however , the author used far too many adverbs as he wrote the story .
which person is supposed to die ?
this is n't romance .
she did n't consider it helpful .
it often feels just a little bit forced -- possibly because she was rushing to finish it before she died .
this in itself was really quite pathetic .
there is something not right about this story .
this book is simply not worth that price .
the chapter goes on to briefly explain what research has shown about baby 's vast brain growth and its later decline .
the characters were unrealistic , plastic , shallow , saccharine .
as i type , it was an onerous read full of predictability and new - age morality .
great story but it was ruined by all the graphic sex .
pretty weak , if you ask me .
the most likely reason is that they do n't exist .
so dull , boring and pointless , in fact , that i will not waste much time going into depth about just how horrid it was .
it jumps around so much that you just get lost and confused .
it was so boring i did n't even finish it .
' & ' i'm not giving this book a total zero because it is coulter after all .
it would be one thing if there were actually something special or interesting about him , but the only thing that makes him stand out are his bad dreams .
i will admit to a lot of scanning and skipping in this book , because there was just so much wasteful filler .
this made for very dull reading .
essentially , more opportunistic than beneficial , and that 's an issue to be wary of .
ended disappointingly .
if there was some slightest shred of plausibility i missed it .
i did n't connect to the characters like i wanted , however likeable most of them were .
i believe it would have been much easier to take if he had made his explanations through dialogues instead of monologues .
certainly did n't feel like i had a whole book .
for the most part , this book bored me to tears .
