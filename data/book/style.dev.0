i found this narrator to be insufferable .
over what ?
there was no tension , no sense of anxiety , just alcoholism , violence , rage , poverty , denial and living on the " dole " .
not a book i would recommend to anyone
her main characters are annoying .
sadly i found this book to be a bit disjointed .
just ca n't take the writing style , almost juvenile .
i suspect part of this is because the author did n't do her research , and part of it is because of the author 's own biases .
but it was n't enough to save this book .
was hoping for so much more .
i understand that she had to tie up lose ends ; but it felt like a very badly wrapped gift with an even worse present within .
i do n't think his book is the last word on the subject .
disconnected ?
it is too verbose , not focused , tries to cover way too many topics and does not succeed .
there was also a very graphic sex scene .
the plot was convoluted , the writing was poor and repetitive in places .
there is no substance to his writing .
this was ... not any of those things .
simplistic pop culture .
it has a lot of colored photos and rather random advice , but certainly not a planned out " diet " or food plan to follow .
( the comments here are in response to an earlier version of this review .
to me , she was nothing short of rude .
not - you could pretty much see where it was going from the " get go " .
and then obviously falls in love with him .
if the author makes the creature too unbelievable , the reader will just not buy into the concept and dismiss it as wacky .
their jobs never seem to go anywhere , and the plot never seems to go anywhere .
the charactors are not particularly interesting .
it did n't help even a bit .
too much like a soap opera ..... no substance for me .
broken people , expensive china that can not break .
why ? )
by moving slow i mean it did n't grasp me .
the characters are not interesting or plausible .
the problem is he 's taking on a huge topic and throwing generalizations around as if his words encompass the whole .
not very interesting , not funny and no incites .
i noticed those pages were left out of the publisher preview .
this one was just pain boring .
i would try another of her 's because she has ability .
this kind of predictability is to me one of the greatest disappointments i can find in a book .
i did n't only because it was a review book .
the photos are funny but , a tad repetitive .
this book is awful , which is a shame .
a disappointment so far .
then publish .
but as an adult reader , i was disappointed with the book .
when i 'm reading about a couple on their way to love , i do not care to endlessly read about the other people in their life .
amusing but not worth purchasing .
" what about butterflies with tiny machine guns for self - protection ?
as for the ending , it was disappointing .
but the bad outweighed the good .
i wo n't spoil it for anyone that wishes to read it and find themselves in the same position as me but i would n't suggest it .
they are far superior to this subpar effort .
a good professional photographer can tell a story with his photos , working with their lighting and composition , but this is just a bunch of amateur - quality snapshots .
some are flat out wrong .
this gimmicky book lacks depth despite trying to be profound .
the book was n't horrible and it was n't great either .
he 's the weak link in the book .
he is a funny guy and i 'm not a prude , but there is way too much vulgarity and bitterness .
it could be me but i thought the plot a bit simplistic and the sex and romance pretty boring .
ridiculously overwrought .
not that i was in the same league with these girls , but i wo n't say i was a saint either .
it 's just a shame that the book was written so poorly and the train of thought was poorly organized .
excuse me if you are a fan of hers , i knew nothing of her work when i started , but what was written on the cover .
none of the characters were interesting .
the story fails to distinguish important info from furniture descriptions , and there 's way too much discussion about what the protagonist thinks someone else is thinking and why .
no real chemistry between the h / h .
the characters were not compelling .
i was really hoping for a good story here .
at least partially - one can not help buy get better at something that is repetitively practiced and analyzed .
thank goodness it did n't cost much to buy otherwise i would have wanted my money back .
he meets the h and before long discovers that she too has the same disease .
i know many people are disappointed with the ending , and if i 'm being honest , i am too .
there is also far more pointless dialogue as well .
for the most part the story consisted of parts that were redundant , cheesy , weird , and/or ludicrous , which in turn made me cringe .
( it is assumed that books on evolution are generally published by academic presses ; not so for id .
( on a tangent , i believe that an earlier reviewer said this book seemed to have been written with the intention of having it made into a film .
this book should be bought used as cheaply as possible or borrowed from your local library .
i read this book for a book club .
until that happens , i suggest you avoid this book .
this is about as pedestrian and formulaic as it gets unfortunately .
it 's trash .
she was superficial and just plain stupid .
but the writing just did n't measure up to its ambition . signed , confused
i tried to get into the book , but could n't .
really stupid things .
this is a really good example of a really misleading book description .
as it is , not as total a waste of time as it would be of money .
gosh , but this was a boring story .
* perhaps she should just give it up and go to bed .
she started out her psychology sessions by telling the guy to sit down and shut up , then told them how to get over it ( whatever the problem ) .
the problem is that the story was n't all that great .
the story line broken , fragmented , and just bad .
i felt the momentum of the story never gained any speed .
does n't get suspicious when the officer watching his house leaves without telling him ?
that 's too bad , but there 's so much knowledge available in this information age .
i did n't like the still born birth of their infant daughter .
it is just too disturbing .
i could not finish the book because i just did n't care about the dry , flat characters .
however , there were a couple of things that really irritated me and forced my rating hand .
if you 've read the others , do n't bother with this one .
this is contradictory .
this is ridiculous and i refuse to purchase your inferior tablets , if you do n't fix this i will only end up using the nook store instead of yours .
( me , i 'll probably have to take a class where someone can show me what to do or get the " for dummies " book .
this book is bad !
the book itself was short with lots of boring filler .
will not anything by author he 's too crude in his writing
neither of which anybody would buy . the timeline is confusing .
although we had a lively discussion , it was mostly about how disjointed this book was .
unfortunately , rather than being helpful and inspiring , this particular cd set is redundant and boring .
for the die - hard jury fan only , and only from the library .
this book pretty much does n't really have a good guy to root for ( unlike the previous books again ! )
this book .... stinks .
carver - i feel it is rather confusing how they trace it back .
there were several other slight problems i had with the book that did n't make sense , but they 're spoilers , so i wo n't mention them .
in this book he is but a shadow of his former self ( hence the title ? ) .
this is by far the most depressing book i have ever read .
and that is very disappointing .
a waste of money and time .
there is little to recommend this frustrating and ultimately disappointing novel ; the characters are flat and uninteresting , the plot feels disjointed , and the ending is completely unsatisfying .
i thought it was awful but i had to finish the book . i did nt like the friendship between brothers .
i do n't think you need this book unless you really have no ideas at all , in which case it 's as good as any other book .
a friend took it off my hands so i did not have to pitch it after all .
furthermore , the author had wasted too much time to elaborate the importance of small talk .
nothing really jumped out and captured my attention .
i thought the story line was a good idea , but it went nowhere .
i felt like it never really told the story .. it was n't as deep as his other novels .
ok , that sucks .
storyline ( because this is supposed to be a romance novel , right ? )
! the plot itself has some clever contrivances .
there are allusions to it but no actual descriptions .
however , the content is poor . so are the various examples and explanations peppered throughout the book .
buyer beware certainly applies here
without given out any spoilers , i just felt this book was all over the place .
sorry but thumbs down on this one .
for example [ potential spoiler ?
alas , i could n't even finish it .
i am not saying there is anything wrong with anyone 's religious beliefs or their right to express their views .
in a mediocre thriller ?
i found that very annoying .
it is clearly a formula romance , but more problematic for me was that the plotting was poor and the denouement was almost unconnected to the rest of the book .
not that the author does n't know about these developments .
i just did n't understand the reasoning there .
it is as if , to use an example .
the characters and story were predictable , i do n't feel like i gained anything from reading this .
i did n't care as much about her when she was so different . in terms of plot ... most of the big moments were seen coming a mile away .
i felt like i was being violated while i was reading it . to further explain my position , i am not interested in excessive profanity and sexual content .
i would never have wasted my money if i had known how the book was written .
the title and the topic are the best things about this book , but the content does not deliver on those promises .
i do n't usually write negative reviews , because usually there are plenty of reviews already there if a book is n't being well - received .
i paid full price for the book , too .
the characters and dialog fell flat .
overall i just found it repetitive and dull .
i did n't care about these people , why are they suddenly together ?
i do n't know of too many that did n't have a crush on her .
i just could n't plow through it to the end .
in other words , it did n't line up with scripture as i understood it .
there are n't any new characters .
if her name was n't on the cover i would have thought someone else wrote .
i would like to know the author because he is the strange one - not the story .
i am not one who is picky about writing style , but i could n't look past this one .
i found this slow to read .
this book is supposed to be funny .
bad - ass should n't be confused with warrior .
impossible to suspend disbelief , and way too much angst .
the story changes ) but his records are available online and are pretty generic .
in my opinion , reading this book is a waste of time .
so i finally get the names straight and i am halfway through but ..... nothing has happened yet !
you do n't care .
the key problem with the author 's extremely verbose prose is to understand his detailed argument .
this is his big selling point , however , when asked to provide evidence of any of the above why does he run & hide ?
while some parts are fascinating and insightful , others are just repetitious and verbose .
with each subsequent book she gets more and more immature .
this book ( if you can even call it that ) is a complete waste of trees .
the books are rip - offs .
i thought for a while this was to be a satire , but it was not .
the concept seemed interesting to me .
this was banal and uninteresting .
then she lost me .
there was nothing about this character that would make me want to learn or read anything else about her . was this supposed to be a comedy or a mystery novel ?
maybe someone needs to grow up !
it is painfully boring .
" but that film seems to be the author 's primary goal .
unless you have spent the election period on a remote island there is no reason to buy this book .
an altogether miserable read .
or maybe you will just quit before you fall .
no where do i find anyone recommending soy for babies .
another annoying factor is the sentences that made me ask , " what ? ? ? "
except , she sucks at it .
no , this just did not come off as a thriller and the character were disappointing at best .
without really explaining what it meant was distracting too .
it is accompanied by puerile and downright insulting statements ( e.g.
pages were made of paper .
it has no real plot or message .
the author seems to be reaching .
what an absolutely disappointing read !
it was predictable - realistic even - but it felt out there without any substance and irked me emotionally .
i skimmed after i was halfway through to see what happened .
it had some parts that were believable but others just seemed to far fetched .
i ca n't begin to explain my disappointment with this book .
i did not like the ending ) .
i thought this book was a most depressing read .
i was disappointed because it had a lot of potential .
people just are n't evil for no reason , as is implied in the book .
may be fine for children , in my opinion not suitable for adults .
this book was a complete failure .
i am so happy i did n't spend much money on this used book , and unlike another reviewer , i am absolutely not ruined for any other books !
i found this to be a plot - driven , superficial drive - by of a novel .
the characters became super annoying .
sure , i get it . but this is not real life .
not very engaging to read .
andrews could have gone in with this series , she chose the most absurd , ridiculous , and least entertaining path .
also , the entire work seems poorly edited ; some names are needlessly coded and some are surprisingly not .
i really wanted this book to be everything the cover and reviews said it would be , but was greatly disappointed .
( i am not overly impressed with them either ) and less focus into her historical .
i just did not like this book for a myriad of reasons to include the principal characters .
did he time travel too ?
perhaps the movie will reveal more emotion ( it is supposed to be the other way around ) but as for the writing , check this out .
most of the men are juvenile .
there was n't much in the way of character development or world building , and the plot , which had some serious potential , just did n't hook me .
they affect only a few pages and all that 's wrong is a very badly placed left margin which leaves a very narrow text .
the characters were boring .
why is n't there an index here ?
it is really saddening to see how popular this trash is - how long did it take the author to write this ?
perhaps , i 'm being too politically correct but that 's my honest opinion of this book .
" which is too bad .
yeah , she could be a bit of a pain , but it was not her fault .
not really worth the expense .
there was no hint to this aspect of the character until the confession at the end , which made the whole scene unbelievable .
is this an attempt at a joke that has no place in such a study or is it just completely useless information that has nothing to do with the topic ?
they did n't add anything and were an annoyance .
as an adult , i found it interesting , but the confusion about the intended audience was a constant distraction for me , so i 'm not a fan .
i normally would not want to own this book , i would get it from the library .
the majority of the book , though , is relatively unremarkable chick lit , and that overwhelms the noir sensibilities and values .
i do n't think she has taken this trial seriously .
as for the romance , it was quite underdeveloped and you do n't feel the chemistry much .
there is no real romance , no real character exploration , no real plot , no building up etc . , just ( cheap ) laughs and some sex .
what a flat ensemble !
the plot quickly followed the dialogue and i sadly gave up on the book .
wanted to toss f - bombs all over the place .
but she 's not , she 's a wimp .
while i like her books it 's obvious that writing novellas is not for her .
this happens several times throughout the story and it starts to get a bit tedious .
the main character and his father were unsympathetic .
no redundant boring conversations .
too gross and unbelievable .
just as unformed , just as random , just as scattered .
this just does n't go together at all .
the only thing missing from this " b " grade movie plot are black and white hats to differentiate the bad guys from the good guys .
i will say that the book did keep me reading , if only due to a sick morbid fascination with what was going to happen to these awful characters .
after setting up the characters , they all become flat and unappealing when they begin to interact .
oh yeah boring
whatever it was , i failed to find it , and i found nothing to replace it , either .
but in fact there is scarcely a shred of historical accuracy or scholarship in it .
problem is ... who cares ? ? ? ? ?
i am no historian but the gross inaccuracies detailed by others below are concerning .
the gospel is not so brittle as this author seems to believe .
barely anything happens in this book .
i really did n't care for this book .
but his argument was less than convincing .
that is the entire stupid story .
too bad about her son which really was a tragedy .
it 's barely sci fi .
it was extremely contrived and i was extremely bored . the hotel staff was soooo clich&eacute ; it hurt .
did some bored reader count ?
after all the hype i had to see what the story was about .
and there were lots of repetitive scenes , continuity errors , and just plain typos .
it 's a fatal attraction that is supposed to drive the plot forward , not into the ground .
i do n't read a lot of memoirs so i do n't have prior experience to go on .
the descriptions of the circus tents are nice , but there is way too much of that and hardly any plot .
it just was n't that much from a thriller perspective . this one can be given a pass .
she did n't even come across as a nasty person .
well i tell you so you do n't waste your time too .
ugh , what is with this trend ! ?
" i ca n't finish this stupid book .
i found this book very hard to read , since the author jumped back and forth continuously from past to present .
no where .
the best i can say for it is that it is hackneyed and plodding and sometimes confusing for no reason at all .
a satire should be amusing ; this was just pathetic .
sometimes that 's a good thing but this time it was just too far fetched .
however , what this book greatly lacked was a believable or even likeable main character .
well i tried it based on reviews .
his father 's name is mentioned only twice and his mother does not make an appearance in the book until it halfway over .
a foolish off - the - cuff statement by a low - ranking person is taken as an explanation of national policy .
but there was no heat for me , no emotion , i did n't feel the characters or empathize or relate to their stories or situations .
instead the narrative focus is on whatever 's immediately in front of the main character .
okay , a casual glance at the advertising blurb suggests an interesting story line - so one buys the book : only to be thoroughly disappointed !
but some of those words were as foreign to me as could be . simply put , this book was a complete and utter disappointment .
no more than classic advice her , nothing revolutionary .
i was prompted to buy the audio version of this book for a long drive .
i never give up on a book , but i have on this one .
why believe them ?
i am having mixed feeling and i mean mixed .
he thinks that everyone in the world is like that , and it is annoying .
i am not blonde , but this offensive metaphor serves only to continue the existence of such stereotypes .
yawn . i just felt this book has so much potential and it failed miserably .
but i hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book .
the dialogue was a bit sophmoric at times and really did n't seem to deep .
this assumption was wrong . quite frankly , i just could not sustain any interest in this book .
for this reason , i was neither completely engaged in the story nor in the characters .
what i heard was was mostly tired old lines .
so why build a historical novel around an anachronism ?
too much melodrama is attached to too many details .
it 's scarcely fit to burn , much less read .
its such a pathetic cop out .
sorry i bought this one !
the kind of research the authors do not find politically correct .
character development still good but plot line very thin and predictable .
they seem completely re - written . the end also seemed rushed and more like a summary than an actual story .
i have to agree with the reviewers who said that this book does n't develop characters or a coherent story well enough to engage the reader .
i was bored , and donated it to the library .
the ending was rushed as if the author became bored with writing the story !
there was page after page of detail about how utterly empty she felt .
what kind of advise is that ?
problem is i have seen the same situations where it did nt work .
his anti - capitalist stuff seems very outdated - though this must be deliberate , i think .
the original novel was not a story with a " happily ever after " ending .
this might have been workable if it did n't seem so predictable and was n't as cleverly written ..
affect the plot whatsoever ?
most of it seemed pretty uncalled for too .
and why has her speaking regressed ?
not too far into i decided i would n't waste any more time on such boredom ! ! !
except worse .
this book starts off with a bang , but then it all goes down hill .
this was distracting to me .
readers who prefer tight storylines and simple language will find this very disappointing .
the mood is there , but there is little tension , and it is too predictable .
and i mean struggled .
this book is a reference , nothing less and nothing more .
i did dislike this book .
i found myself skipping several pages at a time to try to find a part that was even remotely interesting .
after reading this , i felt depressed , not entertained .
and most of the other characters are not that engaging .
that took away from the sex scenes .
would n't be taken seriously ?
the mothers in this book are just disgusting .
just remember to be cautious of errors , especially in the figures .
the plot was same old same old , with a bit of added thoughts and setting but nothing more significant !
already that is too much .
i bought the book based on the high user rating but i found the book to be far less satisfying than what i expected .
i am not reading any other books by this author .
however , as this book goes on the mystery starts getting a little old .
matthew almost disappears from this book as a character , becoming something of cardboard cut - out in the background .
but this story does not make you laugh - and laughter is all boyle 's novels have to recommend them , which i think says it all - do not bother .
unfortunately , even the most pivotal parts of the story are downplayed as they do not really do anything or affect other characters in extreme ways .
it does nt feel as if it 's leading to anything .
... a stupid joke without the verbal equivalent of an elbow in your ribs ) .
i could n't fully immerse myself in the book because i kept wondering how things worked . from there , things did n't get much better .
christine gets shot , its just all in all miserable and yes , it lacks emotion too- unless you count power hungry and greedy as an emotion .
but this one was kind of a miss .
but he let me down here .
this book does not work as an e - book .
this book was one of the worst books i have ever read .
it was a quick read , but largely because there was no depth to the plot .
only someone with a lack for storytelling could screw this up , but alas this author manages to do so .
the talent just is n't there .
this book annoyed me endlessly .
and not enough emphasis on the story line itself .
i did n't even finish reading this one .
this book just was not my cup of tea , and i 'm sure legions of others will feel the same way .
it 's much better to read some kind of atheist propaganda against god than this book .
that 's it ? ! ? "
it was unbelievable . a woman is not letting some man touch her inappropriately while kissing her man .
neither do her women characters .
so i really have no idea what it 's about .
it was thrown in and just sorta dropped .
and at this ending it is where i was extremely disappointed .
the plot of the story was difficult to follow and ended leaving me hanging .
it has become the same basic formula book after book with fewer and fewer laughs .
i find much of it hard to follow .
if you must read it check it out of your local library , do n't waste your cash at the bookstore ......
sorry . if you want to know a lot about the story , read the other longer reviews .
the heroine is attracted to the hero because he is handsome and rescued her .
it is n't that i was too " lazy " to complete the entire chapter , let alone , the entire book .
it was just so bad .
this was a lesson in buying kindle books .
while there were definitely funny parts , they were too few and far between .
it is shameful that the rights of free speech pertain to this colossal piece of garbage .
sorry , i just did n't care for it at all .
it may be the way of the world , but i still do n't think people should have free sex at will .
and the style of writing seemed juvenile .
a pop quiz ?
nothing like it should be .
ok , maybe i 'm being unfair .
please excuse me if i choose not to jump on this bandwagon .
it was too detailed for my liking .
like many other reviewers , i personally could n't make heads or tails of it .
i would like my money back please !
i do n't think the author could have made it more unenjoyable to read .
his reaction is beginning to bore me .
it feels like this author tried too hard to make a story out of a good idea , but was pressured by the publishers to make it quick .
i think i 'm too old for these books .
the graphic detail got to the point that it seemed either gratuitous or smug on the author 's part .
the characters were hard to relate to because they were immature .
there 's really nothing interesting about the book .
i did n't ever read a few pages because i knew i had not read it .
instead i feel that the author offered no real proof , just the challenge to skeptics to prove what he says is not true .
it was n't a bad story , but for my tastes it needed to be better edited .
i love books that make you feel ... the only thing this book made me feel was bored .
the formula is missing the frequency term , and the summation limits are wrong .
this is nonsense , the " financial meltdown " was due to massive fraud via overpriced securities , and this was not an accident .
" overall , a lot rides on your own tolerance for this sort of deus ex machina because that 's the whole premise of the miles between .
there simply was n't enough action going on in the story to support all the long passages of angst , doubt , strife , and uncertainty .
in a word : disappointing .
we already had anti - feminist and misogynistic overtones , we already had a shallow and petty plot surrounding a shallow and petty character .
unfortunately for me , this book is the very definition of " dull . "
about " them " it 's long winded , shallow and insufferable , and long - winded , and repetitive .
big surprise : another disappointing ds novel .
maybe i was hoping for too much because i was definitely disappointed by the end of this one . the best part of this book was the characters .
authors sending me a message usually = the plot is going to suck .
but after reading it , i did n't feel inspired .
artistic license is one thing but this is just too much .
i 'm beginning to suspect that you do n't care about me at all , but that you just want to sell books at any cost with no regard for humanity .
like saying dogs should n't sleep in your bed anymore ?
it just feels hugely unsatisfying . i could n't finish it .
her peers do n't like her now because she 's not easy to like , not because they 're overly mean .
do n't be fooled by this books books cult status .
in all her soul searching she became weak and boring . the story itself is misleading .
it 's more like the diary that someone with chronic insecurity would keep for their therapist .
i 'll start off by saying i really wanted to like this book .
it 's very badly written .
that is n't to say there are n't redeeming factors here because there are - it just was n't enough for me .
just not ones that are so predictable and slightly ridiculous that i wanted to gag a little , then swoon . )
it 's not very readable , and it 's not a reference , so it 's been pretty much of a waste .
the experience of gambling is described so poorly that it is difficult to gain a sense of its excitement and what it means to the people involved .
ok , part of my dissapointment with this might have been with the narrator .
but instead of looking into the reality of real logic that we actually use , we 're talking about arbitrary rules that the experts themselves admit people do n't even use .
try it if you must , but when you have yanked all your hair out and given up , return it for a refund !
i could n't have been more dissappointed .
it was ok , a little over the top on the unbelievable scale but , whatever .
look elsewhere , including to the original sources , if you 're interested in educating yourself about mental illnesses .
the end felt like i was watching a very bad and cliched b - grade horror movie ending .
does n't really do it for my kids .
the thing is , i agree with your thesis to a point .
it 's not that i do n't like a happy ending , but i 'm glad i got this from the library and did n't pay for it !
but then the storyline fell flat and rushed .
not very sexy ... people who are more like dogs but who have people traits having lame sex against a tree ?
too many wasted pages of math to assess your reading speed and not enough technique .
the author does not sufficiently establish motives for the central characters to behave the way they do .
it ai n't subtle at all , and even being minimally homophobic myself it gave me some insights that i really did n't want .
this one 's worse .
do buy that book -- it is fabulous . this book is a disappointing follow - up .
this book would have been greatly improved by some incisive editing , for starters .
i guess when it comes to this one , i just do n't get it at all .
there was too much talk and not enough action .
i am a criminal lawyer and so am perhaps not easily shocked , but i suspect any alert reader would be tired of this book before it ended .
there 's no reduce / recycle ; even the " reuse " is a little iffy .
the problem is that a very significant character is introduced at the very end of the book , which really spoiled the whole story for me .
there really are not a whole lot of good things i can say about this book .
there was a torture porn feel to the proceedings .
a complete disappointment .
the strange sexual orientation of the book 's social order was confusing .
the intro had me with the awful mother making him do the unthinkable , then huh ?
his premises are baseless , his conclusions smack of an utter lack of emotional maturity .
the characters are simplistic and predictable even though the author attempts to imbue them all with skills and accomplishments so extraordinary that we find them interesting .
still it was boring and i did n't care for the writing style at all .
i purchased this book without reading the reviews -- big mistake !
i kept asking , " really ?
she was absolutely useless there and was more of a distraction than help .
no sex !
this is not what the title suggest ..... please allow me to return and process a refund .
i could not keep my interest in it and never finished it .
i confess i did n't even finish it .
we should not have to figure this out .
way too much description , large sections had nothing to do with anything and were n't even interesting from a reader 's standpoint .
this book is not bad , and kudos for the author being so young , but i was not personally thrilled .
i 'm getting these books at my local library ... spend your amazon dollars on something better .
however , what i got instead was a bizarre , ad hominem rant .
there is no real character development either .
i hated the language and the moral situations .
overall a clumsy attempt but i can say i have hopes for this series overall .
halfway through , still waiting for anything interesting to happen , i gave up .
there was no plot and the story was just boring .
so it was annoying to have her alluding to their earlier appearances in books that were equally as bad as this one , or worse .
the dolphin in question was so depressed over being used as a test subject for so long it just stopped breathing .
lastly , the author hardly shared any personal information about herself and this was also why the book was not particularly engaging .
it felt like the dialogue went on too long in many of the conversations .
there is flow between chapters but not within chapters and some of the information presented seems to have no more purpose than to provide bulk .
it was just too much and not enough at the same time .
the anecdotes are presented in short , almost sound bite like , snippets that are spread throughout the whole of the book .
save your readers the struggle of stumbling through this abomination .
i am sorry to buck the trend of reviews here , but i found the text irritating and the recipes and photos unappealing .
it 's not that 's it 's bad , exactly ... i want to like it much more than i do .
i returned this book because the layout was so terrible , i knew i would never use it .
you do n't get what 's going on yet ? ?
needless to say , i 'd skip this one .
and i didn&#8217;t . not at all . but the thing that i disliked the most about this novel was the fact that it didn&#8217;t have chapters .
i went into this book with rather high expectations .
there is so much i did n't like about this installment of this series .
the conclusion to the series i can not help but feel disappointed .
was n't interested in reading any further .
supposedly they were at the crucifixion .
i thought it was poorly written , especially considering it was a team effort .
it might not have been too bad if the author would have realized that he 's not as funny as he thinks he is .
the plot idea was good but the author failed to deliver
they 're out of character , not staying true to character .
i do have to say that it had some interesting parts , so i was n't bored throughout the entire book .
it 's cheap , but even so , this edition is not worth the money .
i 'm not sure where the glowing reviews have come from .
i found the book slow in the beginning and trite .
this was too long for how little really happened , plot - wise .
i ended up being very angry at the time i wasted slogging through the diary portion of the book .
if she is getting paid by the word , she is making a fortune rehashing things .
i certainly did n't care what happened to any of the people in the book .
some of the material was very disturbing , but i 'm not sure how good of a representation the main girl 's sororities are of sororities at large .
i continued to find myself skimming than actually reading .
this book was the biggest waste of time i 've ever read .
i am not required to write a positive review .
" oh god , save yourself .. read the operator manual to your refrigerator instead . "
i should have read the reviews prior to purchase .
it made me cringe each time she said it . that aside , i did n't find much fault with the narrator .
the characters were flat and i did n't care whether they found love or not .
so i leapt upon this book , but quickly tired .
what else could explain the constant mentioning over and over again one 's so - called credentials .
i 'm not ashamed to say that " i did n't get it . "
and that is why i did not care for this book , because i did not care for the characters . will i read it again ?
i found the plot slow , and the emotions very unjustified .
and when i say that , i mean i read start to finish , but i could not stand to read every word .
maybe it was just my frame of mind at the time , but i could n't get into it .
i thought the book was a little slow to get my attention to begin with ...
it is a juvenile novel , not for adults .
plus , the story goes nowhere , and at the end of the book , nothing is resolved .
the conclusion : basic plot was good , the rest of it was garbage .
it is indulgent and somewhat crude at times .
the plot was not exciting at all .
i wish that i did , but i did not .
who wrote this garbage ? "
he was obnoxious , cruel , stupid , etc etc ( insert pretty much any negative term here ) he is selfish and self - centered .
the author 's habit of pet - names began to grate .
the radio parts of this story are just plain stupid .
this biography appears to be complete and well - researched but is buried by facts , names , dates , etc .
too many names & characters ! !
there was no back story for anything .
since the former is n't very interesting , it 's no surprise that this one is n't either .
i did not enjoy this book which is unusually for me .
i do n't buy a cozy for scenes of abuse and torture .
it 's pretty short too !
no evidence , no accounts , no references , nothing . if you 're looking for something more compelling than a spiritual pep talk , you wo n't find it here .
unfortunately , a lot of it was rather poor , and in many cases not even poetry .
maybe another time i will try again .
the premise seemed interesting enough , but this book never quite delivered for me .
i 'm reading , i 'm not very far in , and i 'm having huge issues with the book .
why did she even agree to that ?
he then argues that it is only because humans are stupid that we even think there needs to be a cause at all for anything .
names are all alike , i did not finish the book and am not planning to .
but the ending ... !
unlikable characters , dragging story line , and dark themes made this an awful read .
maybe then i would have finished it .
this reprint is an attempt to generate interest and sales in the title again .
if that s your thing you may enjoy this piece of garbage .
i suppose there 's no accounting for taste .
it was good up to a point , then it was just stupid .
it seemed to me almost as if king , having researched the time period extensively , did n't want to leave out the slightest detail .
the notion of a notebook written by a deceased mother was just awful .
a lot of people grow up with crappy parents and crappy lives for periods of time .
the heroine quickly turned out to be an airhead -- and a potential murderer .
could have been a taught short story instead it is a confusing novel that does n't really get there in the end .
but there was too much jumping back and forth across topics within chapters and too much rather dull historical minutiae .
i was thinking of something else when i bought the book .
well , no , bacteria will not do the rest when it comes to your toilet paper .
i did n't care what happened to any of them .
i loved ella enchanted ; i was very disappointed with this book .
i am not kidding , that 's the whole recipe .
please authors just write the whole book to sell !
this just was n't any fun .
the story was slow to build up , and when the climax happened i almost missed it !
i do n't know what happened to my beloved author but his books are just unreadable .
i did n't fully hate it , but i really really did n't like this book .
the writing is sub - par , the charcters are rediculous , there is so much repitition that it really robs the underlying storyline of value and its just boring .
however , this novel was not all that i had hoped it would be .
i 'm not sure whether i should buy this feeling that it already sounds inaccurate .
i found the writing style to be odd and hard to follow .
i have read gruesome books but this one was just too much -- i could n't connect with any of the characters and just wanted it to end !
no reliable book company would print so many statements which are " hearsay " or " unsubstantiated " .
but the idea that the sex had to be so graphic .
i disliked the whiplash this book gave me .
but the writing is unsophisticated , with much repetition .
a " holy " excuse is n't required , just any kind of rationalization -- plus ignorance .
( spook seemed such a promising title from a genuinely talented writer . )
furthermore , the explanations of the grammer are weak at best .
then we get random violence and death that has nothing to do with anything . without hesitation , i will say this is the worst book i have ever read .
even though the book claims otherwise , this is a diet .
this book had all that , but it just was n't enough .
i expected more scientific information .
clearly not what i was expecting .
as it is , i do n't even care about how the story ends .
that 's an interesting argument to be sure , but ultimately unconvincing .
most likely , the truth lies somewhere in the middle .
how is this okay ?
the villain 's reveal was out of left field but not in a good way and the team 's reaction to him and his demise was troubling .
while her classic book almost introduced " exotic " food , the food in this book is a bit dull in comparison .
this is just tedious .
if you consider yourself progressive and see no contradictions in the current ethos of " equality " and " liberalism " you probably will , too .
i had no idea it was a religious book .
but this ... this thing is a nightmare of twee .
it 's difficult to care about any of these selfish characters as they consider cheating , do cheat , and then feel bad about the cheating .
i just feel the concept did n't hit the mark .
i very rarely start a book and then not finish .
i do n't recommend this book .... it is a bunch of baloney .
i did n't care for the writing , let alone the account .
it was n't even worth that .
but clich&eacute;s do n't substitute for sound public policy analysis .
omg .... so pathetic .
i wonder if she did n't simply have different moods ?
the plot in this book is weak .
i do n't understand how this got any good reviews .
if i could i would return it for a refund .
let 's not look at it any other way , because obviously , the trial is tainted and does not provide anyone with the reality of this poor girl 's murder .
personally , despite some positive reviews , i am no longer interested in these characters .
ok , i tried .
there is no major plot line , no story or characters and references to the eighties are few and far between .
no , do n't buy it .
the book goes nowhere and as another reader reviewed , very tedious .
something to make the reader what to read on , in stead of dry and confusing words
the grammar was just as bad .
i love the other books in this series but the character development or lack there of was so poor .
unfortunately , i liked the book considerably less than the other ones , so it turned out to be kind of a mixed blessing .
same thing happened at the end of the story .
problem .
you do n't believe in doubt .
luckily i did n't pay for this book , i downloaded it when it was free .
odd did not think he was related to female lead .
they slow the narrative .
but i could not be drawn into his characters .
but i have to say that the too - cutesy jokey language in the story breaks up the narrative and makes it hard for a kid ( and an adult ! )
too much description of their surroundings but not enough on their character development .
you support it or you do n't .
it also gets a star for some likeable characters and plot creativity . however , the author uses fake drama to round out characters that are actually thinly drawn .
other than that it is basic propaganda .
while that 's not a huge deal , it contributed to my dislike for the book .
i unfortunately could not get into the story .
for me it was just so many names and confusing events .
i did not care for either .
oh , this is a hard review .
i tried to pinpoint what i hated about the book and the closest i could get was not enough dialog between the characters .
but as it plods on , all kinds of extraneous information is foisted on the reader .
actually , the narrative bits at the beginning and end could easily have been left out . the novel was n't terrible .
if one is missing then the whole experience is basically ruined . this brings me to the inevitable time to rate the novel .
i left the book thinking that the author did n't understand the subject very well himself . it 's an interesting topic and therefore there is something to be gained here .
sh * * , d * * * , h * * * , god 's name are also frequent .
i mean why does everyone like this chick ? ?
during the entire read , i failed to see any plot .
i do n't usually cross over to suspense / thriller plot lines , so it could just be me , but i did n't enjoy this story .
this is a book that meanders and flops about looking for cohesion and a thesis .
he sits in on this diatribe with the good " doctor . "
if i had n't wanted to see how the curse was broken , i probably would have given up .
i rarely make a statement such as that , as i am a rabid fan of the printed page , but this book is simply awful .
the story line is utterly predictable ( i think i just finished it to confirm i was right .
though the premise was mildly interesting , it falls far short of its intended mark , due to its overall lack of tension .
but they fall short and just leave the reader confused in the end .
this book was poorly written ( tenses anyone ? )
i also hated how certain chapters began where a character 's interactions were described , yet you did not know who this character was until later in the chapter .
i figured maybe it would get better later on .
that&#8217;s not even good writing , it just wastes the reader&#8217;s time .
the novel simply does n't do anything with them , or anything more than could be done in a short story .
there was just too much going on in this book ; it could have been much more involving and interesting if it had been condensed .
the premise sounded like fun , but the actual pages inside turned out to be dull and taxing .
i was surely not expecting it to end like that !
this book is just bad , ca n't believe the author even proof read it before publishing .
this book on the other hand was a difficult book to get through .
this seems irrelevant in pursuit of his ideological agenda .
it was mostly about positive psychology and talked about flow and various other similar subjects , but provided little or no depth exploration of curiosity itself .
the dialogue is choppy and the story jumps from event to event without resolution .
it starts out almost halfway able to follow , but by later on in the book you have no idea who is doing what or what character is even talking .
i found it hard to keep up because it was written like a thought and i find it quite difficult to read the way you think .
it did n't appeal to me .
overall , shabby , cruel , and implausible .
the same - sex desire of the narrator is purely based on sex , and the physical attraction of male 's bodies .
why this divergence ?
i was all the way disappointed with this book .
there was also something preachy , almost condescending , about this book that i ca n't quite put my finger on .
i thought it was n't well written , leaving the depths of the characters wanting and the dialogue too simplistic .
i never try to figure out " who did it .
there is nothing in it .
they sounded the same , and i simply did n't get drawn into their lives and heads the way i hoped i would .
this did not happen for me .
so utterly unbelievable .
but most disappointing was the ending .
characters are cardboard .
i 'd much rather read about forgiveness .
even though the free sample was good enough to get me interested in the story , it became increasingly boring from there on ...
mr hunter 's writing is a little dry and uninteresting .
without hesitation , he said , " oh no , i did n't see that at all .
too bad it fell so flat .
i found this book to be rather odd ! !
an ok book .
the advice is clumsy and probably wo n't help .
oh please !
and let me not leave you under the wrong impression , we 're not talking your average , run of the mill sex , nor even kinky sex .
it is also really long , which makes it all the more disappointing when the payoff is so scant .
its unclear why he shows up again and why she lets him get close to her . overall the end was just incredibly confusing as to me .
this book and its thesis have been completely debunked by more serious scholars .
i so wanted to read it and like it , but if you are looking for a well written book , i think you will be more than disappointed .
not in the slightest ! !
i wanted history and romance and this book fails to deliver .
then the book posits another question following that which goes something like this ... what if eating or killing the bug would save someone 's life ?
weird . no resolution .
the main character is surrounded by gullible people who never stand up .
repetitive , condescending , and annoying .
this book bored me to tears .
sadly , by skipping paragraphs , i did n't miss anything .
what exercises the book does contain are poorly described ( i.e. , insufficient detail to be done at home ) .
what a piece of junk - a take off on an old movie 9 1/2 weeks only worse .
unfortunately , i feel these essays are sub - par writing and the topics are forgettable .
this book is poorly documented and the author is so obviously biased that i am unwilling to accept his unsupported word , and most of his words are unsupported .
now , she just seems immature and irresponsible .
it is very difficult to locate information in this book .
does she tell her friend that this guy is a jerk ?
i would n't want this sellout non - expert 's opinion on anything .
but this novel just could n't hold my interest .
i quickly lost sympathy for the father when we see he 's a no - good piece of nothing .
this book left me feeling tired from all the brain work necessary to decipher it .
however , it did make me feel better to realize i 'm not the only one still struggling .
also badly written .
i was very disappointed in the fluff and thin story line .
it was hard to get into .
the characters are annoying , immature and one - dimensional .
not bad but nothing truly special .
where was the editor , if not in the process , what about after the manuscript was presented ?
the author fails to do this , and consequently fails to write a believable story .
this is religious dogma thinly disguised as popular fiction .
i felt like most of the tales were supposed to have a darker feel than what actually came off for me and that did n't really sit well with me .
referencing the above point - it almost seemed like the author ran out of time and had to wrap the book up in a few short pages .
i decided not to finish reading it .
the writing is pretty elementary so it might be decent for younger readers .
the ending was so dissatisfying for me .
i 'm not looking for great literature here , just something to hang some decent laughs off of , and unfortunately did not find it .
at times i had no idea what was going on and in all honesty , i did n't care .
implausible one review states and implausible it is .
if a scene can be deleted without incident , well then , it probably should 've been .
can not believe i actually finished this .
the characters are not lovable .
either way , its her worst book .
save yourself the time , trouble , and the headache and read something else .
this book lacks development at all levels .
if that is , indeed , the case , i can think of no more persuasive reason to avoid anything he 's written .
this time seemed that no one wanted her . even the death in this book was n't that exciting .
i do n't imagine she would sell many copies if she were to detail the lives of average sorority girls .
the writing was n't great and the story was a bit far fetched in the end .
i had far too many things to do and other books to read than to continue with this fat slob of a book .
it lacks character development and focus .
but it was free .
he seldom varies his sentence structure , resulting in run - on sentences .
i just feel it could have been expressed better than it was .
there was just so much wrong with this book i ca n't believe it .
it was so silly and fluffy .
but the book goes on and on with the same few points , and gives lengthy examples and anecdotes that just do n't ring true and sound almost childish .
the story as a whole was pretty cheesy and uninteresting . i will probably not read the rest of this series .
but this was ... just goofy .
he was n't out to prove how good he was or how bad they were .
i found this book to be depressing with no hope for a good ending .
ella , the main character , did n't have a brain in her head .
ok , let me start by saying that i 'm not a literary genius .
i wo n't give away any plot points , but given what happens in the beginning , i found the end of the book particularly hard to swallow .
i know the area in which it 's supposed to take place .
i do n't recommend it unless you enjoy bland , uneventful writing .
that 's sort of the kiss of death -- like she 's a good writer , but this one is not good enough to say anything good about .
i marveled at the aforementioned subplot 's banality .
mostly very dry .
why did the prices rise ?
returned book for refund .
i found this book awfully foolish .
he 's got nothing original or interesting to say , and says it all in the most uninteresting way possible . do not waste your money or time on this book .
for entertainment , buy something else .
it turns out that this is a pretty limited poor man 's version of a sales thesaurus .
guy starts paper to please his old flame .
the whole diary thing was absurd from the get go ... i mean leaving it in such an open room where anyone could find it seems preposterous .
now they are formulaic and dull .
this may be many women 's cup of tea but i do not like this book at all .
the ending was also rather weak .
i guess i can , but so unintelligent - ly ?
if all else fails , make the characters rudely obnoxious in the a perceived effort to be considered gritty .
it just did n't ... flow .
people move up from the lower income ranges to higher income ranges constantly .
any interaction he has with the h is vicious and awful and i hated him for his behaviour .
but if anyone is pompous enough to think that she could take on this classical author , she should have at least the wit and talents required .
is this supposed to make us think she 's brave ?
for me , i was not familiar with the author , and will probably be avoiding her in the future .
this book was just a little too sappy for my tastes .
obviously his idea came completely from combining the tv shows " survivor " with " lost " .
possibly the worst book i 've ever tried to read .
it is getting dragged out and i wonder if the author has decided to go for the money instead a writing a good story .
the casting was not very good , and the movie did not have the same kind of excitment the book had .
her advice did not stop a tantrum in its tracks .
however , about halfway through , the characterization starts to fizzle and the characters seem to become nothing more than pawns in a giant game .
for whatever reason , my review on audible was cut off , and there is no way to edit it .
perhaps the book was not selling enough .
most of the sentences / paragraphs / chapters in this book made little sense .
nope sorry , instead she became a love sick puppy .
this is the worst programming book i 've ever seen .
she relies heavily on the old " there 's water in the ocean so my point is true " argument .
i 'll bet it 's pretty lousy .
by the endless stories of addiction , near death experiences , licking his addiction cold turkey only to right back to it were tiresome .
this book is a walking cliche .
worse than that , it had a message i did n't want my toddler to learn : " you do n't have to work if you do n't want to .
but that is not what the book is supposed to be about .
they might not take it . life is too short to waste on this garbage .
if that was a portent , it did n't work .
i have no idea what the heroine was supposedly attracted to .
nope was n't there .. sorry john but this is not your best work .
i was disappointed with the part on budgeting though , as i 'd thought this book would excel in that area .
just awful .
in other words , she does not come across as a dedicated writer to me or even a hard worker .
please do not invent new elements without a grade school knowledge of chemistry or physics .
the print is tiny and the book is formatted in a way that makes it impossible to increase the size of the font .
she sounds like a self centered little girl most of the time .
overall , very disappointing and not my kind of book
and frankly , by the end , i could 've cared less .
too chopped up and technical .
( not a fan . )
this started off intense so i was interested for awhile , but , there were so many characters that it became so confusing and just plain annoying .
i still do n't understand why this is getting such rave reviews .
if i did n't have a personal policy against rating books one - star , that 's where i 'd have rated this .
it was embarrassing .
we have a terrible problem with the human population explosion .
although i have to admire her taking on the subject matter , but i just ca n't do creepy weird like this .
what a waste of money .
read the whole thing cover to cover waiting for it to get better .
the book goes into elaborate detail to explain the direction of various kinds of wrinkles with way too much written material .
was n't really for me , but my family is raving about it .
but this was a very weak opening book , and that 's why the exceptionally low rating .
i can not begin to guess what the logic for arranging the bibliography was .
i feel like it 's a book about nothing !
the author belabors a point until you do n't care anymore !
not only did she not have anything new to say , what she said was said poorly .
if there was a storyline , i never came across it .
i do n't believe people knew he was lying .
i 'm sure it was there , it just was n't conveyed through this writing .
here it 's not .
however , it fell short of my expectations .
i was just craving some dialogue that would show personality and build the relationships without actually talking about the relationships .
it was dumb , dumb , dumb .
he seems to be completely accepting of his tendency to blow up , throw things , and generally act unprofessionally during surgery .
this author is using the internet to sell books .
while things are supposed to be mysterious so that you can be " led " into the book , this was just too mysterious and weird .
is this going to get better ? '
i found it dark and unappealing with too much unfinished thoughts
i ca n't believe a woman as interesting as the protagonist seems from accounts of her life , could actually be as boring as she appears here .
they seemed to be placed here and there for shock value and most of the time were mentioned in a cursory way , as if in afterthought .
that is why i returned it .
do n't bother to buy this one and just reread the early ones .
i found myself skimming the last few chapters and then the story just ends in the middle of nothing .
... this novel is a big waste of time .
the text was full of unnecessary crudity and the plot was very weak .
and i hated the main female character .
the writing is just terrible : boring , repetitive , with precious few insights or interest .
i certainly am not going to research all of his " facts " !
i 've never left a bad review on a book before but i truly feel like i did not get my money 's worth out of this book .
this particular title is terribly formatted and makes me want to run and find the old , faithful paperback in a box somewhere .
the quick change of povs , i found to be distracting .
there were also some elements that were simply too " pat " which also took away from the story .
but i also think the title should say " mini book " or have the size in the title .
would not purchase this item again .
without spoiling it , let 's just say i did n't buy it at all .
it 's possible there 's some real information in this book , but who 's going to find it when it 's drowned in an ocean of hostile garbage ?
otherwise , do yourself a favor and steer clear of this mess .
maybe someday i can finish this poor excuse for a novel , but i 'm going to relieve myself of the misery for now .
" do nt think about fat people or you may become fat yourself !
but davies is worse than durant in this respect !
yes , i will finish the series but only because i hate to stop midway .
i 'm ok with plot - driven novels , but then the plot has to be good .
this is just more propaganda that is put out as talking points .
it reads like a textbook .
this was the most uninteresting book i have ever read .
if you 're going to read this book , borrow it - do n't buy it .
there may have been nothing wrong and i 'm just too old for the content , but it did seem a little over the top childish .
i am trying to read more outside my usual genres so decided to give it a try . unfortunately i did n't see the appeal .
things were too predictable . it was n't a book for me .
so this is clearly not the case . don't waste your time , i did it for you .
but it tries so hard to be new , cutting edge and in your face i found myself not caring if any of the characters live or die .
my advise , skip it !
i remember saying that it felt like the author just got severely depressed halfway through .
where are all the good editors ?
i was so disappointed in what was labeled a " book ' !
i am normally emotionally charged reading her novels but this one just meanders along .
i really thought this book would be good , based on the synopsis . i felt that the characters were too self absorbed and the story was hard to get through .
and the ending - obviously there will be another book - the ending was n't even wrapped up nicely - i found the book to be very dissatisfying .
the story is ordinary , the characters predictable and the whole thing inconsequential .
as story after story repeats the same theme , which is a good message , i began wondering when some background exploration would begin .
i would have preferred the cost of a new one rather than this book .
it was completely unbelievable the way it unfolded .
i found this story boring and predictable .
check out the resolution on this ! "
this was not even interesting book it did not even make me want to read the other books in the series .
the authors try to cover a lot of ground with very little research . their ideas about the reasons behind sickness and other physical processes are often not well thought out .
i do not like to write long winded reviews , so i will get straight to the point .
save yourself the time and money .
some parts were funny ( intentional and unintentional ) , but for the most part it was a yawn .
i 've loved the past books and characters , but this one is pretty awful .
the impacts of this kind of business are terrible .
nowhere is his work even mentioned .
if there is none , it 's not a proper dystopian .
that 's not a good sign .
furthermore , there is no conceivable reason for glossing over this important detail except to make the story somehow more dramatic .
sorry - no !
the major flaws are the disastrous plot - points .
i 'm fairly young and just starting in my career really , so i feel i was not the intended audience for this book .
i could not get interested in this book , or past the style of writing .
finally even the narrative is disjointed and poorly written .
nothing is happening except the introduction of characters - all of whom are boring and annoyingly dysfunctional .
* stick to a system .
the characters are cartoony , simplified , boring people .
unfortunately i found the chapter on business plans lacking much .
but i have to give him respect for the language .
the book uses verbatim the script from that movie with a few zombie sentences thrown in .
because that 's what happens in this weird & creepy book .
most were fillers and not even pertinent to the story .
ridiculous , boring pace and unremarkable characters make this book something i wish i had never spent my time on .
they criticise a bunch of other scientists , not by using data , but by saying that those scientists are right - wing .
the tone of the book , that came across to me was poor me ... whine whine whine .
seemed like a lot of running in circles to me .
and i think you will be telling yourself the same thing i did --- it 's unbelievable .
however the pace is a bit slow and i kept waiting for things to pick up .
the plot in this novel feels contrived and forced .
unless , he is completely delusional , he ca n't actually believe what he writes .
his knowledge of terrorism , however , is suspect .
in reality , it encourages misogynistic stereotyping , i.e.
it actually is a frightening idea and very horrible .
i did n't know these characters anymore .
totally turned off .
this is an awful book - do n't spend your money .
high reviews in here are as out of place as the attempt to charge for it .
i thought since it centered around a library , she would like it .
etc . , it just gets a little tough to believe .
it would be such a shame to end the story the way this book did .
for this reason , i was disappointed in the book .
it 's the equivalent of somebody talking just to hear themselves talk .
the sentences are simple in structure , and she is not very descriptive .
difficult to follow the crazy , unrealistic , and boring storyline .
everything is mediocre .
this book was ok , but a bit anticlimactic .
so it ruined the book .
should not even have bothered writing this novel .
do n't spend your money , this book is a true waste of time .
a lot of this book is simple repetition over and over and over again .
the storyline is depressing and tugs at all the wrong heartstrings .
i wanted more from the story .
obviously not my cup of tea , but maybe enjoyable to others , so do read the good reviews before you decide up or down .
sadly , it felt as though it were written by a middle school literature student .
sorry mr jordan , i held on as long as i could .
character growth is short and frankly unsatisfying .
the writing was stilted and the characters one - dimensional .
very disappointing from such a good author .
ridiculous stories that just could not happen .
so why waste your time ?
although the book was short , it was too wordy .
it reads like a self - absorbed diary of a deluded megalomaniac in the midst of a mid - life crisis .
if you build a character up to be sketchy then the expectation will be that he is sketchy .
you cannot convince someone with ocd that their obsessive anxieties are in error and thereby cure them .
neither did she get fed to the gas chambers that ran 24/7 .
it did n't seem to have anywhere to go .
a whole lot of disconnected characters and constant repetition of past events makes this a real snore .
could have skimmed this story without missing anything important .
i do n't think real women , classy women feel the need to curse this much to " keep it real " as the saying goes .
though it did n't seem as if he was seducing her .
pretty good i actually read the whole thing which i will not do if it is really bad .
the plot was ridiculous and unbelievable .
did not enjoy this at all .
this has been highly recommended by some of my friends but i found it tedious and unpleasant .
the nonsense sections where the impossible happens , then it might be ok .
but not this one . not recommended .
that he goes on to save the world is just more typical fantasy , standard for this type of fiction .
it does n't really describe the topic in any real fashion .
i 'm sorry but this feels like utter nonsense .
the story is simply boring .
it 's not a difficult read at all . it 's also not an compelling one .
lots of subplots , but not necessarily very interesting .
there was no satisfaction in how any of them resolved ... or did n't .
this book committed the ultimate sin - it got boring .
and babies ) could be reduced to such a semi - clinical , borderline - gross subject .
i certainly didn&#8217;t get any closure but don&#8217;t feel that it left me with a desire for the story to continue either .
( warning : spoilers ) now to move on to the part i do n't like , the actual story .
someone else may like it but it was not for me .
but making it illegal to discriminate against those with health problems , and making it illegal to cancel a policy when someone gets sick , that is a huge advance .
i could sit here and write an essay refuting all the quotes on the dog - eared pages i created while reading , but i wo n't .
it was dull and cliched ; the few action scenes were not enough to save the rest of the story .
and what kind of self - respecting man - whore does n't know better than to at least pull out ?
i have nothing to add to the other one star reviews .
i felt so sad , angry , hurt -- and so deeply disappointed -- after finishing the book .
the later books are long on setting that does not advance the story , but merely provides filler to , well , fill up pages .
it starts pretending to be a hard science fiction novel and ends up with unexplained zombies and a trumped - up apocalypse .
obviously , there is no love here - it 's just infatuation and obsession . i ca n't believe a woman wrote this book .
i was n't impressed , to say the least .
i am sure no woman came up and told him that .
ad nauseam .
needless to say , i really did n't enjoy this book ...
i was disappointed as the potential for the character seemed good by the description .
in comparison to to we d a scandalous spy , this one just did n't cut it .
i do like his analysis of the life drive and death drive , but perhaps this is not unique to him .
so many pages of empty conversations .
i am sorry that i paid so much for the last few books and they have been so bad .
this book is not a " story " about preschool , it is more of a question and answer ... providing definitions .
jeez ... why even bother ?
to me , the issues and themes just seem too ordinary to me , and , as a result made for a disappointing memoir .
with its slow paced story and uninspiring characters , i struggled to finish .
there was too much meanness between the characters that were suppose to love each other at some point which happened , oh maybe the last paragraph of the book .
do n't believe a single fact from this book .
whatever plot there is - a biography of a sinister and long dead physician - disappears under the mass of medical detail , primarily on genetics .
some parts were so boring i simply skipped ahead .
this started out as an interesting choice , though for me the heroine 's quirkiness rapidly descended into the realm of annoying .
now , do nt get me wrong .
can it run backwards , as it seems in theory that it might be able to ?
the writing is perhaps adequate ... the story is lacking and the characters predictible .
it seemed like a bunch of snippets of action that never got resolved .
some portions of the book become too windy and also preachy .
at some point , she looked at all her lengthy blog posts and thought , " i 've got a book here ! "
a story that except for a few short paragraphs is particularly unfunny and rather a chore to read .
the premises and conclusions of the author appear to be well thought out , but there are few characters and no depth to the few that are presented .
and etc .
the dialogue between the characters were just hard to understand sometimes .
it appeared to have been written by an unskilled author . the author 's prose is very stiff and unimaginative .
but i felt i was forcing myself through the whole thing with no real vested interest in it along the way .
if you 're the type of person that has to finish a book , no matter how horrible it is , i strongly urge you not to buy this book .
or at least startled .
if fact , i think the fool wrote this book to boost his own ego rather than educate .
i had no idea it was a treatise on the subject and the history .
it is purely an election promise work on paper . page after page lists ways to spend , spend , spend ... sorry , that 's invest , invest , invest .
for example , a whole chapter is devoted to talking about a smoke alarm that needs new batteries .
overall for me the book was n't my cup of tea , it just did n't do it for me .
what happened to the bad guys ?
what have dirty weapons to do with the rest of that paragraph ?
there is a lot that is particularly unbelievable ( how does a murderer leave his wallet in the murder vehicle ? ? ?
i surprisingly did n't care for this at all .
do n't waste your precious reading time with this one .
i 'm going to throw it out so it does n't fall into the hands of someone who actually follows her advice .
it does n't make the subject any better or worse to write about . bottom line : i came away from the book with mixed feelings .
i would never give her this book .
i did not find it interesting , so please forgive me .
the title and reviews were appealing .
this book was slow and the story line was cluttered .
the fact that such a woman may be left in poverty or may be raising a child or children alone never seems to happen .
but this book is so poorly written that it takes a strong stomach indeed to wade through it .
this poor writing feels like a drunk writer , the rest of the writing is too lucid and clear to be the result of a drunk narrator .
i have never given one of her books so low a rating .
this is okay , a little weird , but ok .
poor ending to a good series .. this whole book was dull .
none of the characters in this book are likeable ; not a single one .
he 's kind of a suspect .
if you are like us and did n't want to try and find / treat infertility medically , this book is a waste of time and money .
the story is not really fantastic and the events are fairly predictable .
i heard from others in the class who had the exact same problem .
i go into a movie knowing that i am not going to get any personal insight into a character -- unless they 're narrating it , of course .
the characters are lifeless , the plot is lifeless , and the prose is lifeless .
there 's also this music thing to that is very awkward .
there is not really a plot .
this is claim is not only unsupported by his arguments , it is historically impossible .
and i wanted too !
either way , i would n't recommend it .
my impression is that publishers sometimes rush the writer with a deadline and thus the writer rushes instead of taking his or her time .
but in fact he is largely wrong about this .
she 's changed - suddenly her heros are beta males with no attractive qualities .
she did not deserve such a man .
i threw the book in the garbage .
on a positive or negative side , are n't we supposed to be inspired after reading something ?
i found the writing boring so i did not order the book .
not sure what happened here but maybe she needs to move back to her roots and beloved south .
nothing here will help your message go viral .
those who cite / use it are grounding themselves in bogus information and speculation .
it was quite predictable as what the main story line would be .
) it 's never explained why the senator opposes clean , cheap fuel or more to the point , why he would n't make it his own issue .
i was also very angry at god for not existing .
but since money was involved and maybe a book club pick , i finished it .
you want histrionics ?
i wanted to like this book because of the aspect of a fairy being a plant .
i would n't waste my time with this if i were you .
where was the return ?
" for me , it was n't a risk , but a certainty .
... because i only got halfway through before i got bored and stopped reading it .
when writing a memoir there is a very delicate balance between too much information and not enough information .
really i guess i had an extra few bucks to toss down the toilet , do n't you ? !
while i am sure it is faithful to his story , it is weak and very thin .
that would n't be a problem , if she did n't try so very awkwardly to imitate them ! ! !
i 'm not sure why she decided to put out such a bad book .
we 'd better get all of our girlfriends together and fix this horrible problem !
i found none of the characters particularly interesting or compelling and the story was often wooden and forced .
some parts are hard to figure out because of the switching of the babies , and i did n't care for the ending .
there seemed to be no explanation and no lead - up to it .
because the time sequencing of the story by the author , i could not get into any of the characters .
but as it was , i did n't care for it .
i actually forced myself to finish the book because i thought it could not decline further as the chapters progressed .
way too much stamp collecting stuff just to set up an ending that left us hanging .
it was so predictable , & the main story was quick to read , but it was just fluff .
do n't worry if you did n't catch that fine point because it 's mentioned ad nauseam throughout the book .
not his character who has been through so much .
it simply does n't work !
instead , the book is bloated with senseless pirate escapades , where immortal characters can be overcome by mortal ones and black magic lifts pirate combat into a completely spiritual realm .
this book is not as helpful as i would have liked .
flat characters and too contrived .
in other stories the guy is a bastard .
some of the situations bordered on unbelievable and the writing was often redundant .
the only reason her story was published was because of her high - profile job , ivy league degrees and name - dropping .
all leading up to an extremely underwhelming climax .
i just hated the way it was written so much that i did n't have the patience to forge on and find out .
this book was missing that .
sadly though , it was not to be .
so i would not say do n't try it .
there are just too many sexual innuendos from her to even get into the plot of the story .
i have not read anything else by this author .
i would say do n't waste your time .
it 's a rather immature writing style and i 'll forgive the author on that point alone .
so i 'd encourage anyone to not start this book , but if you do you may get some pleasure as you waste your time reading it .
normally , i do n't quit on a book , but i did this time .
i m not going to write a long review on this book .... bottom line , i waited for nothing .
none of this belongs in a children 's book , unless it happens to be in a special category , such as religious fiction .
this is also lazy storytelling .
number 1 new york time 's bestseller ?
i really , really did n't like that .
i have to say , i did not appreciate the author 's dry sense of humor .
beyond personal anecdotes and cultural stereotypes , what does modern psychological and developmental research say about the tenets of the " tiger mom " model of parenting ?
too much boring detail .
i did finish it quickly , however .
he sounds like a scoundrel , hardly the type of guy some pearl of purity would want as the father of her child .
again i was dissapointed .
after reading several other reviews on this book , it seems that i did n't enjoy it as much as other people who read this book .
no other details or explanations or conversation .
his problems , however , go deeper than simple ignorance .
nothing appears factual , which makes it boring and difficult to read .
he claims that the ' u ' and the ' i ' " always appear together , but is most strongly against the ' l. '
instead she fills her book with inaccuracies and anachronisms .
very very lacking in content .
editor ?
in my opinion there were too many other characters in the book that were distracting to me .
there is no plot , no story , no sympathetic ( or otherwise engaging ) characters , no compelling reason whatever to read this book .
this book is just garbage .
" god " may or may not " exist " ( it really does n't matter anyway ) .
a nice try , but no cigar .
that would make it a very expensive digital book !
maybe men just like breasts .
instead he rants .
that 's frankly impossible .
he was a morally indifferent character who became evil .
maybe it is all with the connection to the instability of teenagers , which is probably why these books are n't for me .
i was disappointed and would not have finished the book if not for traveling and needing something to read on the airplane .
i usually do n't take the time to review many of my book club reads , but this one frustrated me only because the story could have been so good !
not only was it too slow but there were so many better ways the author could have handled certain things ; most especially the ending .
no big conflict here ... just the details of a woman 's life whose biggest concern is having a closet prepared for each potential disaster that might befall her family .
the dialogue and endless introspection offered in this book gets tiresome quickly .
* sigh * not even good enough to finish reading .
i do not recommend that anyone waste their time on this book .
however , when i actually read it i was disappointed .
if indeed she had anything to do with this effort .
i guess i missed this section other than some advice to invest in commodity producers .
her eyes are n't even hers which kind of .. oh i do n't know ...
this one had many passages devoted to her recipes and long descriptions of eating food ( a salad became a forest , a fish the whole ocean , etc . )
as another reviewer said , where was the editor ?
the bible states christ was crucified ; mormons believe he was not .
this book might be marginally okay for bathroom reading , but otherwise , it really needs to be updated .
the author states that e - books are just hype and are not a publishing revolution .
but never before have so many been so deceived for so little .....
i can not see any redemptive value in these type stories that are just simply weird and depressing .
" uh -- no !
i did not buy it ! ! ! ! !
then he tells her something and she thinks more terrible things about him and then wonders if she really can stay with him .
the story centers around a book store obviously .
their conversations were thin .
this is over the top nastiness that the author does not pull off in even the most remotely humorous way .
give an opinion !
but scripture does not allow us to do so .
the most boring character in existence .
$ $ $ $ $ $ 's .
i really ca n't put my finger on it except to say the book did nothing for me .
the narrator does n't help ; did she read the book before recording it ?
and in my opinion , it is n't funny .
but i was severely disappointed in the plot .
maybe it was because some of the characters felt trapped by destiny but that idea is completely alien to me because i do n't believe in destiny or god .
however , it was a total bust !
chapter one could be better summarized with a simple statement , " words ca n't capture the truths that a story or a picture convey . "
i could n't even get through this book .
maybe it was because of the whole mom thing , i dunno .
idiotic . puerile .
alas , i bought an e - book form so i was unable to throw the book across the room in frustration over the crappy ending .
yes , segregation and prejudice were reprehensible .
maybe this could have been a good book it the editor had helped the author rein in his unfortunate impulses and eliminate the multitude of dead ends .
otherwise , there is almost no reason to bother reading this book .
i 'll be donating this book to someone who might have more luck with it .
then i did that . "
there is some good information in the book but it 's kind of lost in the mundane details .
do adults really think that teenagers are so naive , they ca n't discern propaganda from life ?
i found it distracting and would skip sections where the most profane characters were speaking .
i did n't even finish this because i thought it was boring .
and if you re sex life is that crazy then maybe less is more and delayed gratification is the way to go .
there is no mention anywhere when writing about the culture of the organization about encouraging his people to do community service or support a charity .
too many other good writers out there .
not much description and i 'd be interested to know where the fire fight took place .
this is the worst book i have read in recent history .
so though the fire and brimstone are mentioned , they seem remote and confusing . in addition , for such a brief book , the needless small repetitions grate .
selling items / advice / services that purport to bring you more of those are easy to sell .
morally repulsive and embarassingly self - indulgent .
he said there is no such thing as super immunity .
the story was too clich&eacute ; , especially because of the twist .
this is a lackluster effort at best and a tangled mess of novel with a truly cheap ending at worst .
that 's a major issue that should have received more attention .
it seems like an excuse to write another book .
horrible ending - if you can even call it that .
it just did n't measure up to a lot of his other work .
oh , the writing was n't very good and the plotting was awkward , but i thought the core concept was magical and hoped the books themselves would get better .
i didn&#8217;t finish reading the book because i couldn&#8217;t get involved in the story at all and it felt just like a waste of time .
not to mention that he consciously seems to ignore the fact that they may benefit an equal ( at least ) number of people .
it was a fast read , but a very poor one .
the idea of the book is good , but the content is so basic it borders on being silly .
i love these characters but sadly i can not bring myself to purchase anymore of this crap .
there is no point in being a scholar of something that you have no respect for and there is no pride to be found in turning out sensationalist polemics .
i had hopes .
while boyle creates interesting characters and the premise of this story has great potential , i was largely disappointed by this novel .
i expected better . i guess my biggest problem with the book is the subtext of liberal dogma and preaching going on .
where is the " conservative " bias in that ?
do n't know what i was expecting , but this was not it .
do n't buy these books , you are wasting your money and time .
not so , and he even says so later on .
i really , really did n't get this book .
there were so many holes and unbelievable " sci fi " created parts that it was actually painful to read .
this little novel has the feel of something that was just slapped together quickly .
i was very dissapointed
there is no mystery here , and certainly nothing thrilling .
i m not planning on finishing this story .
unfortunately , a lot of it was slow , so for every compelling section , there was another one that would put me to sleep .
) the sex is repetitive and boring .
i found myself skipping a large part of the book just to finish it .
and quite frankly the sketches in the book are simply too good .
while opinions and research are necessary to promote debate , if one believes a critic 's interpretation to be fact , the literature suffers .
i was left not rooting for any of them .
instead , i came away slightly bored , i almost stopped reading many times .
but , aside from that fact , there was little to keep me interested .
i was too overwhelmed by the stupidity of the historians not knowing history to really go much further .
this is a juvenile book , not young adult .
nothing they did could make them fight clear of him - instead it had to be him that forced it on to them .
there was no tension or drama .
well , i did n't really care for this book .
the dialogue was clunky , almost like narration instead of realistic conversations .
in a word , this book was teeth - grindingly boring .
the s&m references were more annoying than exciting .
and not in a good way , like the movie is odd .
written from main character 's old memories ... which were boring , dull and slow !
the book simply does not tell anything resembling a complete story .
then it was as if someone else took over the writing of it .
do n't waste your time on this book if you expect something of substance .
i was expecting a fast paced read , and did not receive it .
here , he comes across as insufferably arrogant and sometimes inexplicably senseless .
he shows ( or purports to show ) that various measurements of intelligence that used in the past were biased or flat - out wrong .
this is a very silly book in many respects but it does have a few redeeming features .
he probably ate crap because this book is nonsense .
but i do n't think it worked out that way .
generalizations all over the place - none which even remotely describe me or my experience .
the wheel of time rolls downhill , but more slowly with each book .
i got tired of her woe is me attitude about her build .
it 's like the author completely absorbed herself at times ; then simply said , " good enough " at other times .
not sure i 'm going to finish this one . bottom line is disappointment .
the fact that he even entertains her ramblings makes him seem ridiculous .
because if she had , then the book would be just like any other loss story .
but in their gospels they mention nothing of any of this .
complex character , yes , but pretty pathetic and frankly i did n't care about him .
a couple pages of the book had water damage .
even if you just borrow it or check it out of the library , do n't expect to get a lot out of it .
did too many authors spoil the book ?
however , there does n't really appear to be much of a story .
this story was completely unbelievable .
the sentence structure is odd .
) however , read the other 1-star reviews .
i found the entire plot , as well as the characters , impossible to believe . the other problem for me is the lack of character development .
wow , what a long , boring , wordy , overly descriptive book .
let me qualify my review with the fact that i did not , and will not read the book .
bottom line , i did n't like this book .
" in the section about arthritis , he confirms that the side effects pain medications present are worse than the problem they are supposed to relieve .
it had many issues , the main was how boring it was . the plot .
i did n't , i thought it was horrid .
a lot of skimming just to see how the author handled wrapping it all up but no surprises .
i too am surprised by the high reviews of this book .
with such overuse of this device , i found myself giggling at the melodrama - and taken out of the story . oh well .
the story , to me , really did n't go anywhere .
not for teenagers .......... seriously .
but as i read this book i could n't avoid the belief that i was being sold a pile of goods .
the description are clumsy , formulaic , and downright insufferable .
women 's gatherings / fantasies ?
sure , his philosophy rests on it , but many later thoughts do not build upon earlier thoughts .
i was very disappointed but that is probably because i was thinking the story would be something entirely different .
i tried to like the characters and care what happened to them .
the woman was killing vampires out of a need for revenge for what happened to her parents .
be forewarned i am not a fanboy who hated the concept of " before watchmen " .
only in the land of make believe perhaps is a woman like that appealing .
i can understand why some people did n't finish it , i almost didn't . there is absolutely no character development in this book !
do n't waste your time and money on it .
i should have waited til i could see some reviews of it .
or maybe they know their target market , and i 'm just the wrong demographic .
on top of that , why would the demons or angels have a concept of age like the humans do ?
it tried way too hard to be something good but ended up being a headache i wish i could give back .
but this was just awkward .
i expected to learn about da vinci 's reverse writing .
some people love this book ; i just do n't see it .
i will not read another book by him .
am i supposed to believe that took place ?
there were too many inconceivable coincidences .
i 've read other fantasy novels that were good and had hoped that this one would live up to my expectations .
it was like the author just got bored and wrote " the end ! "
but then the author does say once you have copied the data , you should then paste it where you want .
she would n't even finish it .
other reviews summarize the plot so i wo n't repeat everything here .
i should probably spend a bit more of it writing , instead of reviewing , but i plan to rectify that situation as well .
i could not recommend to a friend .
and not enough of it .
these books are just getting dumb .
" it 's not just a question of style .
of all the " diet " books i have read , this is the worst .
then he gets lost .
would not recommend
unfortunately it misses too many opportunities to give new users the efficient tools which are at their fingertips , and which they already paid for .
and , unfortunately , she puts far , far too much of herself into it .
not to mention i honestly ca n't take anything that he does seriously at that point .
the bad guys are portrayed as incompetent .
they are wooden and unbelievable .
pleasure just did n't do it for me either .
just could never care at all about the characters .
as another reviewer pointed out , none of the main characters were very likable or interesting .
but intolerable is the rendering of the lower case " s " as a lower case " f " .
the charactors are not fully developed and even at the end of the book you can not really " connect " with any of them at least i could n't .
if you are looking for a book on trans - racial adoption look some where else .
this author recommends her own supplements , which is not what i was looking for .
there are some step - by - step instructions on how to do certain physical techniques , but these are mostly useless .
so , basically a setup for a sequel , which left me feeling really unsatisfied with the ending , that -- in reality -- is no ending at all .
who buys this rubbish ?
the story seemed to drag , but then tied together a little to quickly in the end .
therefore maybe its me and not the book .
in fact , they are so horrible they come across as cartoon characters .
may be people who have gone to a seminary can understand the book but it does not seem to be written for lay people who do n't know anything about doctrine .
but the author does n't think so .
you have to have some interest in the characters , but they just were n't very believeable .
the anticipated sex was okay but i felt like every scene was rushed for some reason .
even the stalker did nothing for me .
some are so short that they are not stories but mere paragraphs .
the pretentiousness of the use of literary and foreign references was incredibly annoying too .... trying to make this trite boring book seem somehow intellectual .
i 'd recommend you skip it .
i find this rather infuriating .
or this book is essentially fiction .
i know this review is long , so readers may want to skip to the summary at the end and then read the rest if interested .
i actually thought my ebook had n't all been received .
too soon ! "
only a shallow mind who only gets information from tv can tell that our world is the worst of all times .
my god what horrible writing .
it was fairly well written , however .
each part has a name that does not tell what it is about because the authors are trying to use silly little puns for titles .
talked to her and treated her like a child , but tried to justify his actions to others saying she 's his equal .
do not try to read too far into this book ; there is very little underlying philosophical significance to it .
does n't hold together at all . couldn't finish it .
this seems to be a reference book mostly .
what a disappointment :(
it may be that i just really do n't care for the style of writing by this author , or specifically this book .
" what went wrong " is a poorly stitched - together amalgam of ideas large and small - more often the later .
there was alot of potential here the characters were pretty good .
i got this book based on all the glittering stars and glowing reviews on this site .
not really a crime book .
this was the high point of the book for me , because the revelations were genuinely creepy .
what woman is going to be ok with that ?
the most impressive aspect of this book is the astonishing fact that a book so full of tasteless garbage is actually getting published by a relatively major publisher .
from this point the sex continued but they never got to know each other , little talking was done .
it reads like a poorly done romance novel with a supernatural angle .
this book went in the total wrong direction to me .
i seem to be the minority from the reviews , but i was really disappointed .
it read more like " filler " to increase the word count . most of the book was a rehash of what any reader of the series already knows .
after reading this book , and considering this as a leadership title , i felt excited , energized , but empty in terms of content .
i 'm not into gay literature , and would not have bought this if i had know ahead of time .
he did not need to be charismatic , and he most assuredly was not .
i know , it 's gross and i hated this so much , i refused to believe it was headed that route , but it did and they end up together !
i could barely get thru the book .
it became so predictable that i would n't allow myself to get caught up in the anticipation because i knew there would be no payoff .
the writing is so sophomoric that , other than the sex scenes , it could have been written for teenagers ( or by a teenager ) .
the h was supposedly killed in battle and the h had searched high and low for him before discovering that he 'd died .
it 's really hard to connect with and like a character who has it all .
it just seemed like the author tried to hard to be intelligent therefore taking away the flow of the story .
i thought this book was ok on an introductory level ( and easily understood by seniors ) until i came across information that was misleading .
the problem is in the characters .
this series does not .
however , i plodded on , occasionally running into a sparkling jewel of a thought that i could meditate on .
it was as if the author thought his readers were so stupid they could n't get anything without being hit over the head with it .
i was n't all that surprised by who the actually murderer was in the novel so that was n't too high of a climax .
the biggest issue for me is how cold & hard she became and i did not like how crude she was .
! loved the pilots wife but this just dragged and dragged ... sounded good but just could n't read it
where are the flaws though ?
he repeats stuff alot .
while i do agree with a lot of her basic ideas , the whole book had a ( raw ) cheesy feel to it .
the book did not have the desired effect on me .
( although , it could be argued that they had so many missed opportunities for love so that the publisher could drag out more books on the same people . )
the characters in this book had potential , however , as their separation grew longer and longer , i wondered why she would spend so much time waiting .
it did not hit my spot in terms of being a solid western and simply was a slow read without excitement .
i can hardly get through the names without wincing .
it may have some great insight , wisdom or content , i simply do n't know .
but this book was a huge disappointment !
this book i found to be hard to read and quite boring .
while the book is well written , i found it a bit too graphic for me .
i hate to be the one to disagree but this book did not do it for me .
i also was not expecting the whole dom sub thing either .
too much science jargon .
and the funny thing is , i stated i have spoilers , but there 's really not anything to spoil because absolutely nothing happens .
no need to slog through it .
little snippets of ideas , but no real unifying theme .
i did n't enjoyed it as much as i would have liked but i found myself skipping chapters just so that i could finish it .
i , too , am wondering how this book was published .
maybe you have a great answer for me , and i 'm just not getting it .
do n't read this waste of paper .
i 'd imagine her other novels are better .
but i did n't feel that the graphic rape scenes were necessary .
taking being into such a supposedly dangerous place seriously ?
great idea for a story , however , i just could not get into this book .
try ' skin tight ' instead .
do n't know where to go report it does n't need to be in the area they have it listed !
but that 's simply not the situation . hannity 's book is nothing more than a lame attempt to shift the blame from his side to the other side .
but , his willingness to turn - around now and distort facts seems very strange .
a lot of pages ... too , too much plot ... not all in the believable column .
the story is n't too bad , just badly written .
unfortunately , little comes through in this rather bland .
i really did try to like this book but never got into it ; anyone want me copy ?
her charactor developement is good , but overall it 's too wordy and lacking in real exchanges between the main charactors .
the courtroom chapters , few as they are , hold your interest but the rest of the book is a bore .
i purchased this book on the understanding that it was anti - socialist .
sadly , i quickly ceased to care .
but ultimately this book falls way short and presents a distorted , unbiblical view of god .
the story did sound intriguing however .
it was simplistic , overlong and boring .
honestly , it was just too dry for me .
the author just wove in too many things and people .
is that person completely insignificant historically ?
there was n't much to this book .
i finished this book just to finish it , but i hated it most of the way through .
obviously , i 'm talking to those whom i have described .
this book just felt like it was rushed to the publisher without any real plan to it .
the bitchy mean girls have no redeeming qualities .
if your looking for that kind of class .
this book has almost nothing to save !
with that in mind i was very disappointed .
and that did n't even tie in with the title of the book .
i almost quit reading it because i was so confused about who was who .
i was looking forward to a nifty reference , and i find it to be neither .
this is not erotic sex ; this is n't even an erotica book .
otherwise it was alright .
he was given those looks and maybe asking for more would have been greedy on his part .
have they not put their lives on the line enough ? ?
had i known that this book was promoting a vegan diet , i would have never purchased it .
this is not romance .
this book has no story line whatsoever .
then i was beginning to wonder why she did n't flesh the story out a little .
this one however was n't as good as most of her books .
she 's just a very unpleasant person to spend time with .
there is nothing here reminiscent of it at all .
what errors , in fact , outright fictions are listed there .
but even that is played down .
you would forgive your grandmother for having such bigoted views ( even if you 'd punish your children for such ) , and perhaps the author can be forgiven .
no names exchanged , at least none that i remember . from this beginning i did n't have very high hopes for the book .
i disliked his wife and their relationship did not make any sense .
however this was the same old stuff .
i have to write the truth : this book was not enjoyable to me at all .
stereotyping and caricature pass for character development in all but the major series characters .
apologetic nonsense , not only factually wrong but is guilty of the very delusions that he accuses atheists of .
so i decided not to finish it .
there 's no story , no characters , no suspense , no fear , no anything .
the story was too predictable and cheesy for me .
not that i found it shocking , but i just do n't find that it has any appeal .
i actually read the whole book , hoping for some relevance to the title to be revealed somewhere near the end .
i would n't buy your book if it was the last book in existence .
this book is heavy on the explicit language and erotica , so beware .
" that 's this book . however , i will grant the maps in the beginning of the book are drawn much nicer . i'll finish this series , no doubt .
but where is the fury ?
this did not change by the end of the book .
this is a dark novel which i did not like .
book is much better than the movie , but the ending sucks .
" what does that even mean ?
but given how it ended and the book 's title ... i mean , c'mon .
sure , a couple times it was mildly amusing .
nothing about this book is interesting .
but again , i just might not be the target audience here .
i find that very disappointing , and a bit insulting .
i tried , honestly i did , to find some redeeming qualities in the characters and writing .
never dates , never goes out ?
is someone else writing her books for her ?
utterly disappointed in this book .
it just did n't come up naturally .
the book also could use have used the help of a professional proofreader and editor as it lacked focus at times .
at first i enjoyed it , but then i started realizing that this is mainly about repetition .
she did this once , maybe twice .
their issues became repetitive , and i found myself skimming .
the dialogue , especially the son 's , was pretty awful .
not much to say about it .
the whole cash - nash story was also predictable .
i can see why he 's wistful of the past , but frankly i do n't care .
somewhat choppy , there were several times i ended up having to go back and re - reference earlier parts of the story to get back on track .
to hopefully sell more copies ?
the author and publisher should give back the book 's buyers their money because they were " ripped off . "
the characters are n't great , so i really do n't care who the murderer is .
as a heterosexual male , the other stuff just made me feel a little uncomfortable .
no in between .
so , on that front , i was n't really dissapointed .
maybe this was a children 's book ?
it is full of useless and dubious technical details .
save your time - pick something else .
i normally do not write any .
would this justify his actions ?
the author should pay me for wasting my time .
there are literally pages of conversation between characters that go nowhere .
this is just silly .
anything else is a bold faced lie . the men who write this book are called " castrated " by other males .
do not waste your time downloading another version .
i went back and forth , including to the index - which mentions scene mode , but not the page number to go to .
the descriptions certainly seemed interesting .
the characters were not especially likable and it was hard to connect to them .
the writing and plot were meh .
in the end , i decided to set it aside , as the main character held little appeal and the pace of the novel abysmally slow .
that whole setup is actually offensive !
as for me , it lacked wit and was mostly just crude , which some find to be groundbreaking but in fact crudeness has existed through out the ages .
i expected to like it because he has such fun facebook posts but i got bored with it .
i should have read more reviews before selecting it .
i am still disappointed .
so maybe this card is all about sex !
no , sorry , that does n't cut it for me .
last but not least he should lose whatever professional license he has for claiming to " cure " substance abuse .
.i was not expecting the crude humor i found in this book .
the character development was weak and shallow and the characters that were laid out were so uninteresting and distasteful .
* * spoiler alert * * this book was a total disappointment .
there are way too many typos in this book which was really annoying .
talk about weak arguments .
this particular plot thread was complicated by the fact that the author seems to be condemning the lifestyle but not entirely .
some of the conversations just did n't make sense , given the modern context . some of the situations also did n't make sense .
the " lady " has no problem with this ; good " manners " replace decency ? .
what some have seen as " beautiful " writing came across to me as flighty and disjointed .
it just seems really predictable .
this is very frustrating !
i do believe this book suffers from the famous writer pulls old rejected manuscripts out of drawer syndrome .
while the writing seemed competent enough i did not enjoy this book at all .
i talked to my grandson so i know the ending but ....... just not to my liking !
although i have enjoyed many children 's classics as an adult , i was not impressed with the plot or characters in this book .
he was n't physically strong , nor could he swim or even be a match for the other guy in this book , but he was smarter than everyone else .
it was repetitive and much too long .
it is being promoted through spam mail , so i just assume that it is worthless crap .
just as in the first book i found the writing to be exceedingly immature and hard to get through .
makes no sense much of the time , meanders here and there and we do n't know why .
maybe it 's just me but i was n't really all that interested .
this book is utter rubbish .
it was n't scary .
the characters are unrealistic to the point of making the story unbelievable .
this was a boring , tedious read .
why has n't anybody else thought of something so simple ?
after the last word in the last chapter i noticed there was an epilogue ... couldn't bear it and did n't read it .
i must confess that i found myself fairly bored by the book , having abandoned it at around 2/3s mark .
but to me , it 's just another environmental guilt trip .
a flaccid bore of a book that will test the reader 's patience .
no , you don't . the flowery descriptions of food at some point got unbearable .
not enough material or sample hands were included .
i finally quite halfway .
i am really stunned and fairly insulted by the lackluster quality of this book .
the description of this book is misleading because i do n't think any of the characters go through a " magnificent transformation " .
i wanted to like this book but i just ca n't .
it took all my energy just to finish it because it was uninteresting but the made up language made it irritating too .
this is that bad !
it might have improved if i could have stuck it out , sorry just not style at all .
the problem is much different : the sentences are so awkwardly articulated and turgid that the language is nearly unreadable .
her bad guys are pure evil .
and if i did not have my business in this house , i would consider it too large .
unbelievable . i honestly wish i would n't have read this book .
it was very boring and blah .
unfortunately , information is often repeated needlessly .
frankly , there are too many really good books out there to waste time on one that bores me .
i just could n't get over the fact that the author left out that minor detail & from then on , it plagued me the entire time .
i got this kindle single after reading many positive reviews .
i would also like to once again agree with another poster that the people interviewed for the book were very uninteresting and one - dimensional .
it seemed they were all style and no substance . this author has both characters behaving completely inappropriately for the time period .
this is not meaningful writing -- and although i do n't often ' bail ' out of books , i did with this one .
the writing is stilted and jerky and often goes off on tangents .
i wanted so much to like this book .
i was n't expecting another eat pray love , however , i was expecting something worth reading .
i do not recommend this book .... unless you wanna waste your time .
ok , it was a new release , but still , i was disappointed .
come on - i know it is erotica - but does it have to be stupid ? ? ? ? ?
i tried to enjoy this series really i did .
the book just seemed kind of empty .
i would say the writing itself was solid but i really disliked this book and wouldn&#8217;t recommend it .
likewise anyone who attempts to debate this book on any kind of an intellectual level is questionable .
too many charaters thrown together to keep up with !
if you do n't have to buy it for a class , do n't waste your money !
but they are light , and did n't really leave me craving for more .
there 's only a couple authors that i do that with but she wo n't be anymore .
for anyone else , they will get very little from this book because it does n't contain much . mr .
i would not recommend this book to a mature audience .
that may seem like a small thing , but i was constantly being pulled from the story as more and more inaccuracies came to light .
even the love scenes felt recycled from other books , and seemed to be dropped in as an obligatory element rather than woven into the main thread .
i suspect the author is trying to create the kind of online cult that she constructs in the book around her mysterious director .
however , this book takes uneven and devolves it into plain boring and instilled in me a complete sense of apathy for the characters and the overall plot .
the plot lacks originality and at times borders on ridiculous and might be better served if it was in a comic book format .
initially i thought reviewers were being overly tough on the author .
the story itself is n't particularly original .
i 'm never going to read another one of this author 's books . not recommended .
not sure what prompted so many positive reviews ...
if you can be bothered .
was responsible for whatever " creative " work might be discovered in his book .
i kept reading it thinking it would get better but it did n't .
i found it extremely hard to track the flow of the marginal information presented , and sadly , the overall writing skill of the author is questionable .
this book is replete with gratuitous sex scenes that read more like a bodice - ripping romance novel than anything else .
not a bit .
to any woman that ran out and bought this book , this man is playing you out by having you buy this crap and tell you crap that you already know .
in the end , i felt that the book could have been good , and parts of it were fairly decent .
sorry but i found nothing entertaining or interesting in this book .
the characters , particularly the protagonist are too bizarre for my taste .
it was an alright read .
but it was off target .
reading this section of the book , i felt cheated .
and the characters are so uninteresting .
it is well - written and moves but i was completely bored .
while the storyline is somewhat suspenseful , the writing was just too amateurish .
but these are few and far between and do not redeem the book enough to recommend it .
i do n't think it 's free anymore .
sadly , she did n't use the format to its full potential .
and shame on me for shelling out for this tripe .
i do n't care for this type of writing , but usually it 's manageable from a reader 's stand point , but this one was hard to keep up with .
the relationships seemed very fictional .
there was way to much dialog in the plotline , and not enough action .
i was n't entertained ; instead i felt tired and bruised .
the title caught my eye but as i read through the plot i became less interested .
the book still deals with a raging ardeur , which was as needless and shameless an example of a contrived " plot " device as i ever saw .
raping women is reprehensible and evil and it does n't help solve the racial / gender problem .
you can or can't . this entire book just missed the mark for me and is empirically bad to anyone not looking to defend it .
apparently it has gotten so bad that publishers think that we will pay more for shabby , error riddled productions than for quality paper editions .
the author had the bones of a great story but skipped around and left story lines undone .
however , there is n't enough storyline to make sense !
does n't the death of airhead america tell you remaining lefties anything ?
i normally enjoy historical fiction but not this time .
and maybe it 's my own fault for not checking out this author more before buying the book .
what a disappointment of a read .
the whole " finding his lost son " business is just an excuse to have a description that might actually attract readers .
the book was completely unbalanced , with any good that these folks did almost totally ignored .
this title was originally printed in the silent night anthology and is not not not new material from the author .
i really really wanted to like this novel but it just is n't good .
i really wanted to get into this book because i wanted to see what all the good reviews were about .
i was so excited when the book finally came out but this was not what i expected .
it was very slow going and that pace did nt get any faster .
just a really odd book .
i expected a little more of an introduction / scale to help new beginners , but unless you can already read sheet music this is fairly worthless .
the stuff written between the lines . personally and unfortunately i failed to connect with this book .
this book was essentially a padded magazine article .
i guess one could loosely call it a mystery , but i would never .
the story is predictable and not very original . fortunately , this one 's a quick read .
almost nothing in this book .
thankfully it was free but the time wasted on it was nt !
i browsed through it and soon realised it was more of the same bad writing and childish humour .
and i am sorry .
this author 's prior books have been compeling , and i awaited this one with anticipation .
the sentences are just so rigid like letters or words printed on a cardboard box .
i wo n't even pass this on to other expats .
even though i tried to prepare myself nothing could have prepared me for the letdown .
the heroine asks if he is condemning their marriage because he does n't love her anymore and he states he never said he did .
the ending was unsatisfying and rushed .
i did stick it out .
however , things do not happen that way .
fool me twice , shame on me .
the jumps in chronology are confusing .
i know king is good , and i hope he has a few good novels left in him ; however , this one is n't it .
not much of a story at all .
i do not believe that most people would even attempt to follow this advice .
i hardly know where to begin there 's so much wrong with this book .
the narrator just did not convince as a character .
for most of the book , it was boring .
would pick 0 stars if possible ...
there 's a whole chapter that 's mostly an excerpt from the anti - government manifesto the rebels are reading .
could n't stomach more than a few pages before i bailed .
the conclusion left me cold . but i was already cool to the author , so the ending just exacerbated the feeling .
too many of them were crazy and the rest seemed to have very little point .
most or all the sub - plots were totally unnecessary .
this book had a lot of promise , but it was just too tedious .
then she just became super annoying and not very smart .
i am not an author nor a writer but i at least know a door - stop when i 'm given one to read from .
subject verb agreement was valid .
the rest of the book goes downhill sharply from there .
well , certainly not at attractive as what was pictured , but ok .
he did not ( or hardly ) bother to consider , so i do not need to rehash this .
it does not .
this book was so incredibly boring , i have no idea what it was about .
it leaves me wondering if maybe there were alternate endings written with different characters as the psychos .
i would skip this one and spend your time reading something else .
totally unbelievable : characters , settings , and situations .
i do n't know what happened with this book but it is terrible .
this has been proven false in the scientific literature .
very wordy and low on information .
i do n't get it . the book also lacks actual , detailed , case - study examples .
in this case , it did n't sound authentic so it did n't work for me .
there are comparisons here that do not even make any sense or are just downright inappropriate . there was not anything uplifting or encouraging about this book .
was this despite its many errors ?
i would n't recommend this book to anyone other than someone interested in the series that wants to follow it on .
i do not like the way the story was presented .
this is an insufferable book , almost unreadable , a waste of time .
most of the police in this small town seem completely inept , the state attorney seems like a corrupt moron and the characters are all so flat and uninteresting .
: not for branding / marketing business purposes .
this book was such a pity party .
it was n't interesting and i was n't invested in the characters .
i 'd call him competent ... mostly .
i agree with those who ca n't believe this book was published much less received glowing reviews .
in the past i have enjoyed her extensive character development that extended even to secondary characters , but that too was lacking in this book .
i was frankly disappointed .
but this book is not appropriate for the preschool age it is geared toward !
their conversations did not seem real .
for the most part , the stories were either depressing or so beyond normal consciousness , they left us wondering why we wasted time with this book .
but alas : it 's rather poorly written and rings false every so often and i finished it with a sense of mild disappointment .
don't purchase this book people , it a sickly disturbing tale of a disturbed married couple who can only find sexual release if they abuse each other .
that 's insultingly simplistic . the prince : really ?
i would say this book was all sizzle no steak , except that it was n't sizzling .
i 'm probably in the minority here but the main characters were downright annoying .
i agree with you up to a point .
it was n't in the news for a very long time .
he regularly contradicts himself and his writings are meaningless .
i still do n't know what all the hype is .
but this one was weak .
thin on content and tips .
but then , the heroine just seemed so lonely .
the book was n't too difficult to understand ( unlike the sound and fury by faulkner ) but it was just plain uninteresting .
this had to be one of the most poorly written books i 've read in quite some time .
the characters are fairly one - dimensional and there is n't a lot of character development .
i bought this based on the reviews and was deeply disappointed .
it was terrible and sadistic .
fan but for me this story ... well , it just did n't grab me like his stories usually do .
unfortunately , i thought the writer was very repetitive in the telling of the history .
i just could n't get past how ... moody they were about the whole thing .
major effort that needs applauding for .
i prefer not to read about it .
this book did not deliver on either standard .
the writer displays a pompous contempt for the reader so strong and so pervasive that what should have been a great book is a deadly boring one .
this was a soap opera .
they would only publish them if one of the characters either died or went insane .
" well , i do n't anymore , if anyone 's interested .
" you 're saying it 's blue ? "
the plot is just ... clumsy , the ending is horrendous , the middle is meandering .
i was a little dissapointed .
i just ... did n't care about the characters or what was going to happen to them .
the premise is absurd .
sorry -- the book was a disappointment to me
i hate buying books online - the book was not poorly written but was simply not what i was looking for .
i could scream just remembering it . so survey says : buy something else .
the story of an affair , from the point of view of the other woman .
i felt no chemistry about the characters .
sad to say , it was mostly a disappointment .
however , i did n't find myself trying to figure it out ; i just waited for it to be revealed .
it 's too long .
disguised hate , tasteless offense and a whole lot of ignorance .
it 's not highly recommended by me and not my cup of tea .
the author did n't manage to capture the feeling of life ' down in the county ' as we natives call it .
but low and behold there 's not much details to it .
it seemed to me that the author did not know how to bring the story to a close so it just stopped .
sad to say -- do n't waste your money .
it 's another thing altogether for the writer to lie to the reader .
who is the audience ?
not even good metaphors .
not much of a hero .
it had alot of boring and long drawn out dialog .
i need a connection with the characters to enjoy the read , not just descriptions of the places surrounding them .
according to the title , this book is supposed to tell me how to be a billionaire .
things continue to go off the rails in the final chapters , and the book 's last scene is simply awful .
that sentence would make my undergrad philosophy professor vomit in his mouth .
that pretty much stopped me cold .
i did n't like edge of the moon as much as i liked its prequel , killing moon .
there is excessive profanity which was not necessary to the plot in my opinion .
it was very disappointing to find that the tv series was more informative than this lengthy book .
i found the main character to be childish and irresponsible and the secondary characters had more depth than she did .
i am not a big fatty but i could use some assistance , however , this was not the fix for me .
and the storyline seemed to take a long time to develop .
look there instead .
the action is all but impossible to follow , with far too many participants .
i flipped ahead to see if i was wrong about the resolution of events , and i was n't .
it would be nice if this mystical or existential claptrap was replaced by hunting the real killer .
" " but the man was angry .
this is not a love story in my opinion .
honestly , its not his story that fails here , its his details .
thought it would be the basis of a tv show , but it just was not interesting .
i suggest borrowing this from the library or , at best purchasing the paperback to minimize the cost .
instead they tell stories .
why not throw in x - ray vision for good measure ?
that 's still not subtle enough for the author , if any readers have not quite gotten the hint that he 's a villain .
i was looking forward to reading this book , but was very disappointed .
it shows her almost total lack of formal education thru her very limited vocabulary .
the plot seemed to drag on and on , without really concluding anything .
i am sure i can pick it up where i left off without missing anything .
to be honest , i simply got lost .
she was able to conjure up donation money for her plane tickets , rent , etc . , but for some reason could not save this poor dog .
it 's crap . [ ... ]
i was somewhat impressed by some of his clever science , but totally unimpressed by the narrative .
but there are some parts that i like .
the premise is an interesting one .
it was difficult to finish .
he even slips into the same narration style , snarky comments that are supposed to be humorous and makes a few poor attempts to reference that series .
i could say worse ; but why get ugly ?
he does n't really notice her and she spends most of the time copying his notes .
and there are too many painful plot problems to cover up the blatant mismatch . not a keeper .
the ending is contrived , unrealistic , and ridiculous .
all she does is tell us boring information after boring information .
in fact that is the problem with the entire novel .
i will start off with the positives ... the author has potential and the main character was not a whiny wuss of a girl that can get irritating in romance books .
the book focuses on style instead of content .
a silly beginning and now our hero has even become dim - witted .
maybe it 's because i do n't think having religious beliefs makes me a nut .
really boring with a transparent and barely there storyline ...
the book was truly disappointing for me , and is an insult to anyone interested in becoming better informed .
a similar idea , but much better executed .
but if you want to save your time , check out something else .
does n't write , does n't call .
the growth in the characters happens very suddenly , rather than progressing through the book .
why not do something about the underlying problem instead of pretending there is no problem ?
i hurried through the end of both to get rid of the " oh so boring " characters not because i was so excited over who the killer was .
lots of unecessary profanity .
i do n't even read those parts anymore - i just skip them entirely .
i do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non - stop praise for allah .
its interesting .... boring as heck .
that 's part of the reason i gave up on the book , i just did n't care how it turns out .
) it was so poorly structured and written that i felt betrayed at the use of my time in reading it .
it was difficult to get past all the mistakes that were n't edited and the lack of flow .
no religion should be mentioned on identity cards .
i do n't believe it is at all realistic because there does n't seem to be anything wrong until randomly towards the middle / end of the book .
screw her silly maybe and not to see her as someone with all her marbles in the same bucket .
but there was n't anything really exciting about it .
i have read more of this book than i should have because i keep hoping for it to get better .
it would have been nice to have some clear views of the world , instead , new beings just popped up all over the place .
the diplomatic minutia reaches stifling heights , making the book virtually unreadable ...
a great concept , poorly executed .
i was ecstatic i borrowed this from the library and did n't buy it .
was not what i thought it would be .
for those who are liberal , it reads like a bible but quite frankly there 's nothing worth reading in this book .
they are given training , however rudimentary .
i found the main character flow inconsistent and conflicted --but not in a good , humanity is complicates way .
when i started the book , i had pretty high hopes . this book fell apart in its mediocrity , as basically nothing happened .
vampires are not .
it came out of nowhere : no realistic buildup , no tension , no nothing .
the story was stupid . there were quotes from therapy .
however , i choose to not wallow in it .
literally that annoying .
not worth it by any means .
if you are thinking of reading this book , don't waste your time ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
but that 's not really addressed .
i feel she was sort of flat and boring .
the book has nothing .
the book was just ok to me .
if the guy you are lusting after is sleeping with someone else , no problem , he is only sleeping with her for sex .
the author had more fun describing the lead female basically as a sexual object than a mature adult .
here he could n't .
this story 's main character was weak , boring and uninspiring .
i found it disjointed and anticlimactic ... where were her editors ? ?
the novel starts out promising , with some unusual writing style and a darkly comic premise .
and he still could have kept the title . i did n't dislike the story he told or the characters he used to tell it .
i ca n't begin to illustrate every way this book fails utterly , but i 'll attempt to scratch the surface by showing the faults of the main characters .
it would not happen .
its just a poorly put together book in general .
some parts too full of extraneous detail that did not really contribute much to the story .
i enjoyed some of the characters , but others i felt were totally unnecessary .
this was an okay read .
i have to agree with the vandalism people .
disappointed this time ; i thought it was a total waste of time .
with all of the glowing reviews posted here i have to feel a bit of a skeptic .
there are too many really good books out there to waste time on something like this .
it was vulgar and had a story that went absolutely nowhere .
do n't support this kind of rip off by an author / publisher .
the love story had some redeeming qualities but was predictable .
the characters lacked depth , the plot was very skimpy and it never grabbed me .
this book is do poorly written i could barely finish it .
i ca n't wait to discuss it with my fellow club members because obviously i 'm an idiot .
try the sleeping beauty novels .
for me , a no - star .
i 'm sorry but this book just did n't work for me .
to top this all off , the heroine spent the majority of the book complaining about how someone gave her an insulting and uncalled for review in a national magazine !
i found this story completely uninteresting and unromantic .
yes , i realize this story is supposed to be a mystical fantasy , but it never meshes or seems remotely plausible even within the fantasy world .
i found the book interesting at times , somewhat funny , but overall , a bore .
sadly i do n't remember a single thing about the movie and had never read the book .
although her personal story is integral , many of her anecdotes seem poorly woven in or completely irrelevant .
i totally agree with that statement .
the only red i see is from reading psycho - conservative crap like this .
even that short a book dragged on too long with the endless pages of sex .
i do n't know but it seems not to be for the average reader .
not a very challenging plot .
the editing is sloppy and , because of the way it was written , the story is hard to follow .
i have read just about everyone of her books and i found this one difficult to keep track of all the characters .
the conversation was awkward and i could not get into the characters .
they are utterly blameless , since no big picture is given .
it 's not that the statement is untrue , or that people do n't need to hear it , but it could have been so much better .
i am disappointed that this is such a popular book .
the illustrations are disorienting and distracting .
its like looking at a beige paint sample .
sorry for being really harsh .
i am so sorry to say this , but really , save your money .
" .i did n't think much of her advice to women , either .
very unprofessional .
nothing happy happened .
the were superficial and vapid .
this just didn&#8217;t stick . [ ... ]
but why should the rest of us have to suffer ?
the lack of common sense and appalling disregard for dignity really bothered me .
boring here .
for all the value and interest he gave her before they married , afterwards he seemed to totally take her for granted .
despite the other ho - hum reader reviews i bought this book .
overall , the book could 've been much better .
the lead female comes off as some slutty trash , all though she comes from a well to do family and supposedly was sexually abused as a child .
for me , one of the most important things in a novel is characters . if i do n't care about the characters , i do n't care about anything else .
there continue to be jumps in the facts .
i do n't care about any of the characters , or about anything that happens in the book .
unreadable , uninteresting , confusing , and boring .
:) afterward , however , i thought it was a waste of my time .
but will someone please , please tell me where and when it became obvious that these were black people ?
mostly , there was a lack of consistency here .
i have been listening over and over to this cd , i have found it not to be very usefull .
this is a very boring read .
i lost track .
i bought it with the hopes that i would get some new ideas .. that was not the case .
otherwise , the writing is very simplistic .
completely lack of emotions , feelings , details ( hey , i do n't need everything spelled out , but give me something .
entire too many pages and poorly written .
i would never buy this book with this cover for my kids .
the romance scenes do n't measure up to previous books .
perhaps part of the problem was the protagonist - although plucky .
unfortunately , he did n't do that with this book .
felt a lack of depth in her characterizations !
they are unfortunately few and far between .
this book started out nicely as in the excerpt , but it ended up with not much of an actual point .
while the images are cute , i just did n't like the attitudes portrayed in parts of the book .
but , it seemed the whole plot revolved around sex .
the pacing was slow .
this slows the story down so much , the reader loses the way .
i could n't finish it ; it just felt like the book did n't have anything more to offer .
but the heroine was the worst .
if my husband had been alive , i would not have left him at home , as the author did .
unfortunately , i really ca n't recommend it to anyone .
other than the premise and the title i have to say there was n't anything in this book to redeem it except for perhaps the last line .
do not take any notice of this idiotic book .
the only issue i have is that the scene depicted never happens in the novel .
it would n't be fitting any other way .
" , what was he expecting ?
in short , this was one of the most boring books i 've ever read .
the more general collector or novice should use this catalog , if for no other reason than using the catalog numbers for record keeping and communicating with other collectors or dealers .
it 's a standard romance in the worst sense , with murder and ghosts thrown in to make it sound more appealing .
it advocates whipping small children and hiding it from others to avoid repercussions .
the characters were extremely shallow and you are never really allowed to get to know them completely .
the story is so vapid and dull .
i would not be exaggerating to say that not more than a few pages were used to express detail throughout the entire book .
trying to trick consumers into buying them is just dishonest .
much like the pregnant woman , the pregnancy journal ( if kept updated like it should be ) is going to expand .
no , i did not turn into a lizard or a bird .
please , folks , do n't waste your money on this " book . "
ended up skipping through the chapters and finally gave it up .
all said , i did not hate this book .
however , it is impossible to tell this from such a graph .
the bad guys , with few exceptions , are either incredibly evil or stupid .
there was no story there -- no romantic tension to build and shape into anything .
i did not like the information contained in this book .
( not me ) .
meanwhile -- in another point the book does n't mention -- boys who dislike this predatory environment have alternatives .
any professional reviewer who called his book good should be ashamed of themselves .
the deception , rambling , and exaggeration proved to be too much for my little mind to take .
this book seems to require way too much figuring out by going to other sources .
but if you really wanted a good read , you need to look elsewhere .
sorry , this book just does n't click for us .
i never got past the introduction & the first chapter as it was so redundant , and written in a very boring manner .
also found that the grammer tense kept changing and this was confusing .
as in not credible .
she endlessly whines about all of this .
characters are not fully established .
i bought this book on the strength of the glowing reviews posted on amazon .
but honestly , i could care less .
have no interest in trendy night clubs that were once hospitals .
story was not cohesive .
i do n't care in the least if i read the next book .
i suppose every author in this genre comes to the table with an agenda .
story line not interesting to me .
are they kidding us ?
this was a disappointment .... but not your fault .
there are alot of unanswered questions that bother me .
it 's all rather dreary and slow , and the few moments that twinkle are not worth the time spent to discover them .
i try to finish everything i start but this was a slog and i almost did not finish it .
i prefer romances where the male lead shows at least a modicum of respect for the heroine .
i never really felt the characters were established or the action engaging because it jumped around quickly .
( if i wanted that i 'd go online and read fanfic , i would n't read books .
there 's no variety . there 's also quite a few areas where the authors talk about something specific , but not how to accomplish it .
because , not only is it critical to the story , but it 's identified with hardly any effort .
are just not compelling .
the only redeeming quality i got out of this book is the fact that i did n't waste any money on it , got it from the library .
i do n't know if his career was dynamic or lackluster , but it does n't seem to have involved much .
not as funny as all the hype this book was given .
the hero and heroine spent minimal time together , and i do n't think they even kissed more than twice .
left too much hanging .
very sorry i wasted my money on purchasing it .
unfortunately i did n't find him very charismatic or memorable .
for people who are a little bit of this and a little bit of that in terms of gender this book is complete and utter rubbish .
then just walk away from it ?
i thumbed through the book in the off chance that it was a problem only at the beginning , but it was the same problem throughout .
or should i put that statement in words the author would use ?
the recipes in this book are not what i was looking for .
but i digress .
you completely missed the boat rendering her .
not a very compelling story at all . the audiobook is average or better in terms of production values .
because of this the book falls short on any compelling knowledge .
i can understand why people love this but its just not for me .
the skipping through time quickly and awkward flashbacks were just distracting .
however , i suspect this author 's writing style and lack of " fleshing out " the story would 've been the same .
ok , maybe no chapter really begins like that , but you get the point .
it 's a shame too since this could have been a good testimony for victims of abuse .
it makes books seem boring and unrelated to teenagers .
however , this book really was only okay in both storyline and writing style .
the character of best friend did n't ring true ... sometimes supportive , sometimes manic and no real reason for either . not a bad read just a blah one .
a follow - up lesson in the driveway with her son and daughter - in - law apparently did n't help much either .
i guess it 's a matter of personal opinion , but i could n't stomach the heroine nor could i stand the hero .
the book is just ok if you 're willing to ignore this amateur author 's marginal writing skills , typos and the like .
there are interesting leads and ideas which lead to nowhere .
however , it was hard to make myself keep reading .
what they failed to do was emotionally engage me .
in my opinion , there was too much unnecessary back and forth .
it was very predictable and , like other have said , you do n't get to really know the main character enough that you care about his predicament .
another disappointing factor were the love scenes .
i 'm sad because i was really looking forward to this book and i was horribly disappointed .
it was just so ridiculous .
rather , the narrative segues straight on without interruption .
it is unfortunate , however , that the reader does not get to know much about the author or her alleged psychic gift .
how palatable are they or are they giving nausea ?
this book just drags on forever .
are you that insanely greedy and think ebook purchasers are that stupid ?
too much detail went into ancillary areas .
i could n't grasp what was going on and the storyline was all over the place .... just awful !
i just ca n't get past how awful the writing is .
it just did n't make me want to keep turning the pages .
somehow , i think this one would n't have made the cut were that the case .
could n't finish ( i would n't subject myself ) and returned for a refund .
fail . i'm confused over the whole lightning survivors idea .
this book is written in the same stilted style , with words more usual to adult reading .
however , most of these stories did n't work for me .
which is too bad .
i have read most of sw books and this is horrible .
this was a difficult book to rate because although it 's not bad , for me , it was just ' ok . '
definitely do not buy this book
and there is n't really any advice , just this guy rambling on about how smart he is for figuring out that people need to be loved in different ways .
however , i am really annoyed by the dumbed down style of writing .
i found this to be a complete bore .
if the book was half the size i would have enjoyed it a lot more .
in these times when so many people are struggling financially , i kind of thought that whole storyline was just insulting .
the lines between ghosts and human and dream figures was too blurry for me to enjoy . the book 's too short !
i was so very sadly mistaken .
just maintain a positive attitude , and condoms are n't necessary . such a lie is nothing short of grotesque .
most of this is because the prologue spoils everything , but also because it 's just boring .
either there were loose ends or improbable circumstances .
talk ... talk ... talk , no action , no romance .
shallow city .
but , unfortunately , they did n't .
getting to that information requires patience .
certainly not in a book focusing on beginners .
as far as the text is concerned , i have a strange feeling that anybody with an access to the internet and some money to travel can write such a book .
if i can i 'll give it to someone or try to sell it in a garage sale .
do n't give up on her , for she has many good novels out there .
however , i really think there is nothing good about this book ; i did read the complete book , but found myself wishing it was over .
i signed on to order this book - but after reading the reviews have decided to at least wait for the paperback version .
for example , no woman would have an orgasm at the mere sight of a man .
i finally had to admit defeat and could n't finish .
and i had already heard some bad reviews about its content .
it was poorly illustrated and did n't lend to the story at all .
while the author quotes extensively from scripture to prove some points , he totally discounts other scripture ( often in the same chapter and book ) .
so much repetition in the book , it got totally annoying .
i didn&#8217;t find much of it ; of anything .
the detective was vain as well as obnoxious and he was the least unlikable of the characters .
the decision to use some of these authors as narrators was a huge mistake .
and she repeats that over and over again until you want to smack her because it 's not that big of a deal anymore .
i thought it would be powerful , but instead i found myself not really believing the sincerity of it .
that 's not to say that this is not a well written book , or one that should not be read .
wonder if he was in a drug stupor while writing this book . do not recommend this book and will never purchase another by this author .
i found it to be very strange and i therefore do not recommend this book at all .
i did nt finish the book
skipped pages going through this book , not up to her usual excellent writing .
bad recipes .
i had to slog through it .
still , left - wing writing need not be bad writing , nor as distorting to the historical record as this text 's often is .
now , do n't get me wrong , i understand adolescent crushes and projecting lust on older people .
there were several times where i almost gave up on it .
an interesting military history , but not the claimed bill of goods .
long and boring detail of a political / military history that would be better forgotten .
( but not men ?
dialogue feels superficial & decidedly not of the time period .
i 'm ignorant of any prequels to this book , but maybe it would have made more sense had i read it ( them . )
however , this was really weird !
but , i was really really disappointed .
i can not imagine how the author manages to be published apparently unedited !
i do like the message that you do n't need to be afraid of everything , but it 's not the way i want to convey the message .
" this is an author who could do much better than this book .
i cannot swallow that ! !
then when she is widowed , she is pressed to marry an evil scoundrel ; she just ca n't come up with any way to avoid it .
the characters are a bit too far - fetched but he does have a point .
( huh ? )
it really felt utterly ridiculous .
picked up rather slowly but was fairly interesting .
i could n't figure out why this was published .
i would not recommend the book , especially to young people .
there just was n't any meat to this story . it almost seems as though ms.
i 'm just not interested enough to finish it .
i 'm not overly impressed with this book . this is a sales / marketing piece being presented as a " how to " business book .
no exposition , no science , no thinking involved .
if i had the book , i would have read the end and thrown it away .
however , if you are looking for an objective , unbiased view of this strange story , look elsewhere .
this book dragged out so many boring incidents occurring in the characters lives i could n't even finish the book .
it was slow and i felt like it dragged on .
wonderful premise , very original , but this dragged on and on and on to a very weak finish .
i can understand , however , this viewpoint if one does not have knowledge of grace .
that is not correct .
i would have been doubly disappointed had i had spent money on it .
it was too much work to get through the book . since i wanted to read this book so much , i am going to watch the movie .
do n't waste your money , time , or trees on this one .
the book did n't give me anything that i did n't already have .
i made it through the book , but i am not certain i will purchase another in the series , especially not for preorder .
want any more characterization ?
okay , if someone said and did that to me , i 'd be really ticked off .
on top of its total lack of quality , the book is unnecessarily crude .
i mean really ?
please do n't waste .99 on this book .
i am just not a fan of this book .
this one sadly did not meet my standard of clean or faith .
it did n't help me and was just too much information to easily figure out which parts i did need or should know .
it was an ok book but i got diverted and never finished reading it .
this work tries to be edgy and cool but it turns out to be stupid .
there was n't much clever about anyone in this book .
but he has nothing to say .
insurgent started to get stranger and more improbable as each page was turned ; the actions of the protagonists were more and more stupid and inexplicable .
otherwise , it 's okay .
i was very disappointed with this book .
i skipped them after awhile and found very little else in the book .
even the action scenes were slow paced and uninspiring .
but , unfortunately , as subsequent events have revealed , the book is fiction .
he is really irritating and unbelievably sexist .
i was bored by a lot of the novel , but still impressed by the creativity expressed .
there was a lot of repetition , to the point of boring .
insta - love is stupid .
after all , it was not reading scripture that proved her most important spiritual discipline , but this listening , this receiving of messages from the lord .
maybe i did n't stick with it long enough .
i did n't finish it : ( oh , and i really dislike that word " beep " ! !
does it even count as a book if it is n't about anything ?
it was a struggle to read it as i found the story redundant and very similar to other novels .
why , oh my , why , oh why could our ideal romance not work out ?
it might work .
part of me wanted to finish it because i had gotten so far into it , but i gave up and said ' enough . '
and the plot twist at the end felt completely unnecessary .
grandma ? ? ?
on the surface she was an annoying little sister , but below that she was a young girl whose life ended before it ever began .
i was hoping this book would help me shoot perfect scores .
i thought this book would be good but in the end , i did n't use it very much b / c it was n't very practical .
seems a steal , lack of her own ideas , and the book is just dull .
either there is no documentation or there is poor documentation .
i say that because there seemed to be just as many sentences ending in exclamation points as in periods .
i skimmed through the whole thing just to see how it ended , and was disappointed by all of it .
the house itself conveniently becomes a huge character in this book .
i only finished this book because i 'd already paid for it .
so unhappy .
our culture reinforces this assumption in many , but close inspection shows this assumption to be false .
does exciting = disjointed , completely confusing havoc ?
i generally like travelogues , but this one was pretty boring .
but the final product was rubbish .
i was very disappointed by the lack of interesting material , pointless tangents , and middle school drama that was true to form .
i felt that this was getting lost in this book .
just could n't read anymore .
there is a lot of misinformation in the text that could cause more harm than good .
well , plot or not , dull is dull , i say .
do not waste a dime on this book ! !
consistency would have been great but sadly , it just was n't there .
they decide to send a message .
to be honest , i 'm not really sure what the author wanted the takeaway to be .
much on the garden , a few comments on people - mostly condescending about housewives and peasants .
[ hen / her ?
i found myself skipping and scanning a lot .
i would have done more than mess up his car .
it is not rewarding and i do not recommend it .
this book seemed long and disconnected .
that grant guy was a total loser .
i do n't like figuring it out ; that to me is not good writing .
is there a priesthood or not ?
too much " head hopping . "
the book seems hardly edited from that .
as it is in this case . i have to agree with several of the other reviews in finding the initial premise to be very promising .
stupid . okay i read the story .
i could have returned it for a refund but i just did n't want anymore dealings with the book .
save yourself the time and money and read anything else .
i do n't believe i will be buying the last book .
it did not live up to the usual standards of this body of work .
she ruined it , she simply ruined it .
good idea but not my favorite style of writing .
i feel as though i 'm reading the same plot book after book .
" and why is success " striving to be more " and what is " more " and why is n't an end to be reached ?
an easy read but for me just a waste of time .
but what i found was disappointment . each profile is rather long and , most annoyingly , poorly structured .
their banter is safe . so because of its utter written - in - her - sleep dullness , this predictable subplot quickly became an obnoxious distraction .
and if this author has anymore books out then i do nt think i would suggest buying them either .
the story fell flat for me bc the author did not go into great detail of their younger selves .
the book is a sham , a disgrace to its publisher .
this is the reason why i say that " grounded stories " are simply conceptually flawed . what did this book take from me ?
i think the story could have been so much more had the author focussed on the main character buying an inn and having interactions with several people .
from there it just went into a ridiculous downward spiral .
the book seemed like a series of endless battle scenes interspersed with endless sex scenes .
very hard book to read .
i 'm a fan of this author , but she tried too hard to make this book funny and it came off lame .
the proposition is interesting but either he is too shy to say what he really thinks , does not know what he is talking about or is trying to impress someone .
why is it so that no one called him a pedophile when his marriages were public knowledge ?
i kept thinking an old person was writing it or someone who thought readers did not have many brain cells .
the author is not sure his son even recognizes him . anyway , not a lot happens in the book .
i love osc , but this overpriced short story is a disservice to his loyal fans .
uneven is the kindest thing one could say about this book , which most of the time borders on soap opera trash .
the prose is overblown and poorly edited .
the success of this book has to be from all the media hype because as a book this is a very weak effort .
but very overpriced in my humble bakers opinion .
plot twists did n't work for me .
before buying this book do some research on the author .
this is a very slow read - all description of cold weather and very little action .
but , the ending was implausible , dragged out , uninteresting and spoiled the whole experience for me .
rather it 's the opposite ; the complex and obscure nature of its ending .
author comes off as very egotistical , frequently referring to his other books and research .
but as someone proficient on a pc it was definitely not aimed at me .
she wanted to join a religious order who works with the poorest of the poor in the poorest countries .
i have to admit that i could not finish this book .
we do not need your " saving the world crap "
why all these rave reviews ?
save your money and read personal assets instead .
indeed , there are plentiful amounts of anecdotal evidence , back to back .
he starts thinking about buying explosives to destroy the highway and the equipment used to build it .
to me , the whole this was ruined by turning it into a sermon .
did not live up to it 's title .
the book does n't even mention it .
that 's not very objective , is it ?
save your money or buy it used .
it just is not the same as the others , no suspense , nor wonder .
characters : undeveloped .
it is n't what i was expecting .
it 's rapidly downhill from there .
this bizarre tale of magic and immortality may appeal to its target audience of middle grade readers , but it the strange plot fell short for me .
if it is a stretch at a metaphor , it is poorly executed .
unfortunately , it could n't be further from it .
each character is essentially the same .
i just still did not grow attached to either of the characters .
it either is totally unable to write on the cards or it just rubs off .
if you want good horror / sci - fi writing , look elsewhere as well .
although the road part was kind of fun to read , the climax overall was disappointing to me .
too hard .
i think this book just flat sucks .
orcs are nasty , brutish , evil , smelly , stupid creatures .
it misses a lot of those little twists you expect from him .
if that 's you too , do n't bother .
but let me go at least a little beyond that for the sake of completeness .
the characters the same .
i ca n't believe all of the positive reviews posted above .
i will not purchase anything they publish again .
it made her out to be shallow , slow witted and completely without morals .
it is prime example of how the " story within a story " concept can completely fail , due simply to poor execution .
if there was some reason to believe that there was a high level conspiracy it might be interesting , but the evidence against that is just overwhelming .
the editing , if there was any , leaves much to be desired .
this may appeal to some readers , but it just was n't a good fit for me at all .
very disappointing considering how much i used to love these books .
being pulled into the author 's world just was n't very pleasant to me .
this device gets old very quickly . the book is too long .
i tried hard to see those characteristics in this book , but i just could n't .
i do n't understand the whole demon possessed part - i think that it was n't explained well enough .
to call them beasts or animals is a disservice to beasts and animals .
the exception to this is when a person with a famous name masquerades as an author , cashing in on that name , with a piece of pure schlock .
the idea is ok and starts off kinda cute , but it lacks any real substance .
i almost never just stop reading books but i ca n't waste more time reading this . the story is hard to follow and jumps around a lot and not smoothly .
there seemed to be too much action in this book when compared to the others .
i agreed to read the book , but frankly , did n't expect much .
however , this idiotic author would like you to believe that you do not .
the end result is n't pretty .
the dialogue was stilted and characters just as dull .
i just could not get engaged with the characters .
not sure that was worth my time either .
as others have pointed out , it 's rather dated , but i did n't mind that .
i am not fond of books where there is adultry and it is ok .
there were times when i had to go back and check because i thought maybe i 'd missed some pages .
uh , okay .
like many other reviews have said , " bond villain " .
i really could n't even make it through to the end .
even though i like regencies , this author is so dull she is not my cup of tea at all .
the supporting cast of characters also lacked any interesting , memorable members .
but , he decided on a cast of characters who were , by and large , neither likable nor interesting .
it was not and the subject matter was geared more towards a preteen or teenager .
let 's party in the ruins !
shame charlaine for shame .
just something that i 'm not interested in reading .
( perhaps because i had no previous exposure to this author , i was not privy to some secret logic required to decode it . )
compared to her other books , this one really drags .
it is , instead , just a big blah .
i would like to redeem shriver and this review .
sorry ,
but , what she does here goes far beyond that .
i would suggest you not bother reading it .
the author wanted evidently to emphasize that the war against the machines was a global conflict , and so the story kept switching between various geographic locales .
but , there is little substance to it .
yet , he himself , had an affair with the governess ( who was the heroine 's mother ) , then married someone of his class instead .
i know that if someone tried to kill me than i would do everything i could to make noise .
many negative reviews are getting deleted with no explanation .
but , instead she glossed over them .
the villain was so sadistic and psychopathic -- how can his own evil army stomach him ?
the theme of the letter is not the murders ... the murders are only mentioned as an aside -- which is why it is such an enigma .
none of the characters are likeable , parents are characterized as empty shells sleepwalking through life , teachers are either cruel and domineering or weak - minded and feeble .
not my favorite , sorry
the whole thing gave me a headache and i ended up just skipping pages to get on with it .
to put it bluntly , they seemed like someone playing with a camera who did n't really understand the concept of composition .
it will only end in soul - crushing , anger - inducing disappointment .
it is too much like organised crime for me .
if you 're looking for titillation , this is n't it , either .
a lot of ' wanna be ' almost sex .
got bills to pay ?
instead i got a campy hunk fest with little in the way of story .
it does n't move quickly like the others did .
maybe that was the author 's intent , but i 'm sorry i found out the hard way .
ok , i did get over that .
i wanted some help with dealing with teenagers , but i did not find it here .
after all , if he did n't have that , this book would have been even slower going .
do not recommend this book .
the dialog was full of cliches unnatural .
it just seemed to drag on and on without purpose .
i doubt if the average person would succeed at this extreme unrealistic approach .
i read another book by her that was much better , and was disappointed with this one and could n't even read it .
it 's his autobiography , ghost - written , and very repetitive .
if there was a reason for all of this , by the end of the memoir , it is very nearly lost .
i did n't love the plot or the world like i normally with fantasies .
lazy lazy writing . i threw these books in the trash .
i was nt sorry when i finished it .
maybe i 'll try it again , otherwise money not well spent .
i 'm sure conservatives make the same adjustments for compelling books with liberal authors .
a destroyer running down the beach does n't tell me very much .
any other .
i could n't feel a climax in the story , either .
i 'm sorry ... what were we talking about ?
i suspect that for many women , that is true , but only for some .
but please , if you have read any of the books mentioned by me previously , it will be very hard not to compare it and therefore be let down .
this spoiled crackpot is one of the most revolting figures i 've read about in fiction , and i 'm hard to alienate .
i had high hopes for this story but it was n't what i expected .
words and things just got mixed up and annoying at times .
he claims a lot of ' facts ' about aa that are n't true .
i could n't get into the characters or the world .
it 's like a bad made - for - tv movie with actors so awful they never even achieved ' has - been ' status .
too trite . "
pictures and illustrations low resolution and much of their text is illegible .
just did n't care .
it was predictable and slow .
i just ca n't see why he would be attracted to ana who 's so surly and does n't trust anyone .
the flow , if you could call it that , is interrupted by wordy descriptions , most of which contain large and unnecessary words .
the murder was also more boring than usual .
i just do n't understand what the point of it was , and it was irksome trying to keep track of who everyone was .
the only thing surprising at the end is that it surpasses even your worst expectations .
the writing is simply atrocious .
this book was given to me by a liberal friend . i found it interesting but full of factual errors .
the story is completely predictable and has been done too many times .
many times the plot was muddled and confusing and just plain boring .
ruined the book , ca n't even finish . wth ? ? ?
why did this win an award and such high marks ?
best bet : spend an hour skimming this book in your public library .
those types of descriptions do n't usually bother me , but this one seemed to be worse than most .
" do nt waste your time , money and effort ... what a shame , from reading the back i was looking forward to it .
some of the dialogue is painful .
however , not a book for programmers .
the testimonials used in many cases were too general , lacking in specificity to add credibility to the stated point .
not entertaining , leaves you with a bleak picture of the world .
it has been slow going for me .
" no , " he said .
i did n't really enjoy reading the book .
it was hard to maintain interest .
however , the story could have been told in many less pages and would have therefore been more powerfully told .
it will be useful for my course as an example of truly dreadful polemic dishonestly presenting itself as scholarship .
we had mixed reactions , mostly bad .
but , in general , i 'd say that it was neither particularly funny nor did they generally evoke any real pathos for the author .
none of these things tell me anything i did n't already about how to negotiate , and i do n't know how to negotiate !
the authors are unethical .
-- just pages of fluff . if you must read it - get it from the library .
the writing style is so basic i found it hard to care about anything that was happening .
i kept waiting for more information on the private school murders but nothing interesting materialized .
nice words with lots of adjectives and such , but the characters are stale and the action is flat and predictable .
this was because of the writing , it was stunted for lack of context and perspective .
the last few pages seem rushed .
it would be convincing if there were more foreshadowing , but there is n't .
it is full of self - harm and self - hate with an unhealthy dose of self - pity thrown into the mix .
they offer just about nothing to the experienced , or even intermediate , knitter .
the dialogue is very juvenile , as if it was written by a 12-year - old .
after awhile all you are is bored .
this book was choppy , not paced well and all around boring .
nothing connects the disjointed elements of the book except that they all happened to the author .
when the main character did n't " die " in the first attempt , i cried .
or rather , it can be , but then why not stick to math ?
the dialog between characters is worse than believable , no human speaks the way the characters in this book do . please do not be offended by this review !
really , really improbably .
sorry i wasted my money ...
it dragged on and i kept waiting to something to happen .
ultimately - and this is why the book fails - you just do n't care .
some of the people he profiles and mentions lived when iq tests did not exist .
this one is ridiculous .
i guess i should have realized it 's a book with pirates in it so of course it 's going to have swords , etc .
i wanted to like this book and did read it to the very end with some reservations along the way .
it was depressing and annoying .
seemed all over the map .
the author did a great job of describing the tents , the acts , and the smells but the characters were shallow leaving no connection between them and the reader .
but the plot is getting thin and repetitious and the dialogue can be just plain annoying at times .
thought there would be a lot more to it , but just never really picked up .
the big bad men are sexist and offensive .
they need only have looked at ants .
but an interesting thought .
big mistake just cut the crap and get to the point ! ! !
for an official guide , this is woefully poorly written .
but until then , i ai n't reading any more of her books .
although he aims at novelty there is nothing new here .
for starters , the plot started out as somewhat original and then quickly progressed from predictable to downright ridiculous .
many of the exercises ( e.g. , listening exercises ) would be helpful , but they are basic , and many of them are not really based on the theory .
she 'd lie and say nothing was wrong .
the paper itself is cheap , thin , and unpleasant .
the whole book could have been condensed into a couple of pages of lukewarm information that is not only not new but is condescending in its delivery .
was n't bad enough to make me quit before the end , but frankly , i 'm glad to be done with it .
but hey maybe it gets better further on .
comic book ?
doubt that story too .
i 'm not inspired , and neither is this book .
although it is written well , it is totally unconvincing .
i was actually a little bored . you know when authors create this whole back - story and talk about it a lot in the beginning then totally forget about it ?
author needs to go back for another run at it .
basically , this book was a big disappointment .
i was hoping to learn some significant things about these hymns and instead found theological pablum in short devotionals about the various texts .
it was nt the color of the meat it was how much it was cooked .
this book was pointless .
there is nothing about her to like .
this is supposedly a book about fallen angels , but the only time i ever heard about that was in the extended summary .
i had no idea that so much of the world was ignorant to the power of positive thinking .
but when the events themselves are monotonous and repetitive , a dryly academic voice merely emphasizes how dull the whole project is .
very hard to read .
i listened to the audio version of the book , and it was so dull that i skipped several tracks ( they were just so unbearable ) .
did n't like this book .
do n't bother reading it b / c you really wo n't be missing anything .
but read something
i love books too much to throw this one out , so i 'll donate it .
i guess just imagine a buffalo with a bad case of diarrhea . i'll be honest i never finished it because it was so terrible of a read .
this book was very difficult to follow .
the book did not get any better , even the ending was anticlimatic . my opinion only , please judge the book for yourself .
it was a short read but an annoying , boring and depressing one .
the books have become dull and predictable .
the plot was predictable , redundant , and boring .
another issue is the dialogue .
the writing is awkward and full of clich&eacute;s and poor word choices .
parody not homage .
i bought this book with high hopes of being able to use the recipes to stock my freezer with meals .
i ended up skimming through most of it .
its hard talking to your kids , i do nt even have any yet , but have had to talk to other peoples teenagers and its not easy .
not up to what you 'd expect for a huge best seller .
a misogynistic , angry exposition of the author 's miniscule world view .
there 's no payoff .
all of the critics who panned it were right on the money . there 's virtually no plot and a lot of lose ends .
the whole thing rang incredibly false .
i could n't connect .
it is a good premise to write about , but the author did a terrible job b / c the book is drab and uneventful .
it has nothing to do with science .
the attempts at characterization are so incredibly obvious that they seem insincere .
they were supposedly the words of god .
maybe the author did n't give the story enough time to mature fully .
the reader is subjected to prose that meanders between the redundant to the trivial to the nonsensical .
the premise was enticing enough , since i ordered it , but halfway through the book i was still waiting for something exciting to happen .
the information is beyond boring .
i managed to read the entire book because i believe in finishing a book , even if it 's a bad one .
maybe you stalled out somewhere in the middle ?
it is a complete letdown .
make her a little more clever instead of being a dimwit .
and too many loose ends for my taste .
he did n't even send them a word after how they cared for him .
there were a few entertaining moments in this book , but for the most part , it was about unlikeable people behaving selfishly .
i am tired of typos and grammatical errors .
where are the rest ?
i did n't feel that there was much new information in it .
as a junior high teacher i was hoping to use this in the classroom ... but , the acting on the videos is absolutely horrible and quite annoying .
i did not feel drawn to the characters .
i can not consider this book anything other than an early manuscript , and wish the author had n't tossed it off so quickly when his ideas looked so promising .
unfortunately , the conclusions presented here leave much to be desired .
but this one , is dry ... drawn out in some parts and repetitive .
the discriptions of the building of the churches are brutally boring , i just skipped page after page .
none of them show much interest in or care for each other or for anything else ; the biggest mystery was why they hung around together at all .
this book is n't worth the paper it 's printed on , avoid .
yes , there would be torture , but that was predicted by scripture .
but like all writer 's self - help book , it ultimately fails .
grossly cliched character descriptions and nothing to the characters but the descriptions .
i found no peer reviewed journal articles , and little other scientific data listed in the endnotes .
do not purchase for your ball .
the author is a total fraud .
seems like there was some role reversal here because she seemed a whole lot tougher than he did .
i was expecting a more in depth knowledge of some of the more famous pirates .
does anyone honestly believe otherwise ?
the rest were pretty awful !
i 'm older so what might amuse a younger person just falls flat for me .
the series started out so strong to end like this was is huge disappointment .
please seek help elsewhere , this book is not worth the read .
if you are considering it , please go elsewhere .
but is this really going on in the entire universe or only in the head of the believer ?
it was that bad .
almost like boasting that he could use hard words and write complex sentences , words and sentences would be thrown in that could have been more concise .
in the end , there is nothing thrilling about the climax , and even less about the rest of the book .
the few times they are used as actual characters , it is showing them as stereotypical villians , racist , lying , low class , and underhanded .
my expectations are too high ...
it 's about a terrible crash that came close to killing everyone onboard .
i kept hoping it would get better but it did not .
i sure am glad i got it from the library instead of buying a copy .
however , the experiment did n't work .
that does n't mean that scripture actually supports that view .
except for a few bland references , the novel could be taking place anywhere .
instead it will be a " well there is nothing else so might as well ... " read .
hackneyed plot .
i am definitely in the minority because this book was obviously a huge success
the protagonist is boring .
i get confirmation so far have not received the books .
just a very flat ending for , as it turns out , a very flat book .
i do n't mind paying for a book , but i hate getting bits and pieces !
to make matters worse , even despite the fact he 's totally in her head , it does n't feel like they make a connection beyond the physical .
" oh no honey , do n't worry about it , it 's okay . "
there was just too much here to believe .
the story 's conclusion made only the vaguest sense , and was never really explained .
unfortunately i did not read this book in time to return it , or i would have out of sheer disgust .
perhaps the translator is to blame .
the last book was scattered and facts did not line up .
instead of a historical novel , it was a short romance story .
anyway , i would suggest simply ignoring the book and reading a review of it somewhere and saving yourself the money and the time wasted on this manuscript .
i could n't find any real lessons or good outcomes in the books .
i suppose , i did not care for any of the characters .
this book is just an attempt to make sophomoric common sense seem like profound wisdom .
does he have any underlying redeeming qualities ?
why are they repeating it in full ? "
very misleading description .
da - incompetent bad guy .
this way was not a good one ....
unfortunately the title is misleading , and the book was mostly about the basics of preparing for , adopting , and raising guinea pigs .
i think the author was trying to portray her as someone who was just dying for some small measure of affection , but she failed in doing so .
i am not a fan of extraneous and unnecessary plots elements , which is what i found the drugs to be . so where does that leave me ?
the characters were just off and the story unbelievable .
what did not happen , however , is that i was not drawn into the characters at all .
sorry , this is just a trite romance novel .
but if you 're looking for more , you 'll be disappointed here .
i feel my money was wasted and would love to get my money back .
i hate filler .
and there were moments that were promising , but even most of those fell short .
but he drops the ball far too often .
i have just been more and more disappointed in this series , it has gotten so convoluted .
there was a whole lot going on , yet there were also a whole lot of pages of nothingness .
iffy .
it 's so cheesy and silly i felt embarrassed reading it .
his characters are very poorly developed .
i prefer to have actual psychological references to read , and i wo nt waste anymore time and money reading this mans garbage .
* the writer often would fail to draw a conclusion about what he had just spent pages talking about .
kind of boring especially after you read a few of her books .
i gave the cookbook away because , quite frankly , i did n't find it worthy of being in my home .
i got tired of reading the same lines over and over .
what woman would seriously give this advise to a friend ?
i got halfway through the book and gave up .
in my opinion the main character is actually kind of annoying .
i tried , but found it not interesting to me ; however , it was written well .
this was the worst time travel romance that i have ever read .
does he have a " store " , too ?
at least he is not advocating the sale of under aged girls .
there is some good dialogue , but much of it is confusing and some is just plain pathetic .
and the descriptions of her actions were inconsistent as to her capabilities .
and the characters personality 's were so inconsistent .
the author explained way too much to the reader , as if they would n't be capable of figuring out what was happening .
i mean if you saw this book cover you would expect nothing less .
there 's not a ton , but there 's enough .
the premise of the book is great but just a little too much !
there was n't really any glaring flaw with this novel , it was just really hard for me to get through .
the only character who got rid of any one and may have found mr.
or the writing .
the end promises more , this is where i get off .
but that did n't happen here , with any of the topics presented .
however , if you are pressed for time , i 'd suggest you find something a little more useful .
sex appears to have taken priority over character development .
but instead these are really dark and violent books that have equally dark and violent protagonists , while the antagonists are all torture happy and appropriately scary .
and you 're supposed to eat high glycemic foods like toast while dieting ?
while i understand that 's a stylistic decision , it 's not one that works for me .
the problem is that they are only mentioned once and are never defined so you have no idea what the author is talking about .
no lip kissing ? ?
did not meet that hype .
it did n't work for me , but i 'm glad so many others are enjoying it .
while i 'm sure there are a lot of good stories , insight , and lessons taken from this book , it just did n't draw me into it .
there were some really good ones , but most were totally boring .
the writing was forced and none of his characters had any depth or heart .
no , not as it stands .
i kept hoping i would get some sense of a plot .
i found her to be very self - oriented and unrealistic about life .
the writing was horrible , and the editing was worse .
if so it 's not funny or observant enough .
now , if he 'd just get over his anger and step off that soapbox ...
and that pissed me off .
perhaps it was just built up too much .
this book was okay but truly not my style .
but overall i was really disappointed in the book .
one could not feel much pity for one so self - obsessed .
the nicknames she uses are ridiculous .
i wanted to like this book , but just could n't .
meander around and then meander through a tale of your meanderings .
she blithely claims to be in contact with ghosts and prefers not to waste her palm - reading ability ( ! )
this book does not point them out .
this book is not for the beginner and it is harder and more confusing than necessary .
they get back together because neither of them can stop thinking about how good the sex is .
his writing is filled with unnecessary similes and repetitive imagery , which drag down the already colorless plot .
they are talking about print editions of this book , not this particular ebook .
so there is little credibility in this memoir .
hard evidence ?
without strong editorial control , however , this process appears to fall apart .
pursuing this end , authors routinely label most far - fetched assumptions as " doubtless .
maybe next time she 'll pay more attention to her integrity as an author and have more respect for the would - be buyer / reader 's time and money .
i 've read this author before and i loved the book i read , but this ... this was torture .
a huge police investigation over some blood on the ground is completely unbelievable .
i 'm sorry too , that i had to rate it so low , but i truly felt a warning was needed .
there were even editing notes towards the end of the book that were not erased before publication .
neither style , nor thoughts .
this book is not for beginners ! !
however , if the rest of the book is n't good , i stop reading .
never read this author before and i must say , i was disappointed .
i could not even finish this book , i was so disgusted by the heroine 's actions .
the opening scene is great , but then the author spends a lot of time telling me a lot about people i do n't know and thus do n't care about .
the story was long and dull .
unfortunately , there was no one to like .
i advise the curious to go to the library or purchase from somewhere with a good refund policy .
the sarcastic tone of the book gets pretty old after awhile too .
but her story ?
why write a book like this ?
i ca n't help wonder why the change in publisher though ?
it seemed to drag on and on , and i had to force myself to finish it .
however , these numbers are not representative .
i really wanted to like this book , but in the end , i just could not .
it comes with bad dice .
this one is hard to read and i could not make any sense with the book content .
not just accept it without question ?
my biggest problem with the book is that not enough counsel is given to help sufferers realize that disease is more spiritual than physical .
a " brotherhood " please .
would someone curious about mormons want to read it ?
no real table of contents .
it was the most boring book i 've ever picked up .
i would n't care so much , but laugh were promised , money was given , promise was unfulfilled .
however , the theme of the " noble savage " with mystical , super - natural powers and knowledge is so exaggerated it dashes any authenticity of the story .
the teaser chapter is even worse -- an earlier donor dies on the table because of a surgical blunder .
i found it to be depressing and frustrating when i was expecting a light and funny read .
the characters did n't impressed me .
the characters are unbelievable .... who says " holy crap ! "
this is a poorly written book , and yes it is typical soap opera stuff .
i did n't find this book interesting and did not read much more then a third of it .
this type of book is not their genre .
this book got an a book review elsewhere and that prompted me to buy it .
there 's so much more that can be written to get a better sense of the characters . and the dialogue ? ? ?
i wo n't argue that a lot of material is covered in the book , but it did n't work for me .
this book has been probably the biggest literary disappointment i 've ever had .
there were entire chapters void of scriptural references that bothered me .
this one tried my patience .
this book ended up being a great disappointment .
this does not live up to her other books .
so far , it has none of the aforementioned qualities .
just not the book for me .
i keep buying these hoping they 'll get better .
not , that my corrections of her errors would have done any good .
there 's a story in it , but it 's just too difficult to wade through the dryness to get it .
in the end i found the main character so obnoxious and boring i decided not to continue reading until the end .
it 's just so unnecessary and frankly stupid .
stay away from this book unless you want to start over thinking trying to be non tilted .
i did n't feel she was forced into any of this by her rebellion against not having enough attention from mommy and daddy .
i started to just meld sentences together on my own , but i honestly ca n't believe that a copy editor out there did n't comment about that .
she might find something .
i was disappointed sorry to say .
and then she started living again , but i got bored by the story after that .
this would produce more money for those in affluent nations while providing poor nations an impetus for changing inefficient economies .
however , i do n't think anyone enters that profession without understanding at least some of these risks .
i , however , found the book to be depressing , not funny and almost killed my love of reading .
buying th , is book is a waste of time and money .
unfortunately , expectations were too high . the book was a disappointment .
the synopsis sounded intriguing and then there 's the book cover .
it was like reading the newspaper clippings all over again without the journalistic skills . all in all a very disappointing read .
i found the book disjointed and poorly written .
a complete waste of money and time .
the purpose of plot is n't in this novel .
i skimmed the rest of them and they were similarly boring .
this book is that bad .
save your money , and your brain and do n't buy this embarrassment to our country .
because it is the same plot over and over again .
i tried the drills , and guess what , no improvement .
i " get it , " but i still do n't like it .
however , if your taste runs more toward things like plots and characters , this is probably not for you .
it 's not particularly funny .
the former may well be true , but being ignored historically does not imply that other science is wrong .
too many grammatical errors and unrealistic events .
all the cursing was pointless ( even the women have a conversation about how much one character curses ) .
the footnotes in this book are used to explain things that could have been explained in the text , or really did not need an explanation at all .
names are dropped or alluded to without much if any contextual meaning .
just to clear the air , this book has a major problem : the content is for high schoolers , but the plot is more appealing to middle schoolers .
i 'm about halfway through this novel , and i ca n't make myself finish it .
but why bother if you 're only going to use it as a backdrop for an insipid , shallow romance ?
and that 's why no economic theory should ever be confused with " reality and the facts " .
i think if she had spent some time developing the hero 's character after that had happened it would have left a much better and more satisfactory ending .
the writing is as redundant as the plot .
the description of his life prior to this trip does more to arouse pity and contempt than humor .
shame on her and the editor and publisher .
i too was disappointed in this book .
i definitely will not be wasting my time reading anymore of this authors work .
ill - conceived and poorly written , it achieves nothing in the end .
make no mistake ; paved with good intentions is social darwinism ( i.e. , eugenics ) at its worst .
maybe , it could have happened , but culturally was that something that would really have happened ?
if i could i would burn this book , instead i will donate it to the library and hope no one ever checks it out .
while annoying , this would still be somewhat forgivable .
i guess i never found out how it ended , since i put the book aside without finishing it .
the story line was good , except that the writing was not .
there are just too many other better books out there .
it 's just not what i bargained for .
but i do n't blame him .
unfortunately , i had trouble connecting to any of the characters .
i 'm admittedly really annoyed by what i see as the overly simplified romances that exist in many young adult novels .
heroine was over enthusiastic , hero over sarcastic .
i got a taste of both , and that taste was enough for me .
that he plays whack - a - mole with science , beating it into submission whenever it does n't fit his purposes , is the least of the book 's problems .
the bare bones are there , but i suspect this writer has never taken a novel - writing course and has n't had the benefit of working with published authors .
stop recycling the same old stuff !
this is nothing more than ramblings that are vague and useless .
if she wants to write this " dark " stuff , fine -- get another pen name and do it .
q and a or text is irrelevant .
while good versus evil is very well defined in this book , the plot is sorely lacking in progression and development .
although the hero was over the top from the beginning , the heroine seemed redeemable .
i did not find this book useful at all in regards to learning actual instinctive shooting .
this is like saying an apple is red and a fruit , and not at all like comparing creationism to evolution .
it could have been so much better using the plot where the hero tries to find out more about the author of the book society is conflicted about .
why could n't the author have spent valuable time writing another good book in the series instead of wasting it with this ?
this simply is too large a topic to be dealt with appropriately in the space allowed in the book .
the writer has good intentions but his strained metaphors get a little tedious until finally you can ' t it take anymore !
it was too cutesy for my taste , and the language was super outdated .
for me , it was way too much information .
there is a decent story in there trying to come out , but it simply could not overcome the strained world building and unnecessary melodrama .
i found this book to be somewhat lacking .
we just did n't really get into this book .
all of this comes with a big dollop of corny philosophy and lots of cliche metaphors and bad prose .
ok . which is the lie .
matter of fact , i felt like screaming and throwing it against a wall when i read the last chapter ( but more on that later ) .
this book book is not something i would recommend .
this was a waste of trees .
there is no plot or emotional connectivity to anything in this collection of " stories " .
why did n't the author mine the high school relationship ?
the villain was predictable .
it goes into the wastebasket .
despite the many rave reviews and status of this book , it did not ring true to me .
unfortunately , it does neither for the reader .
i started reading it hoping that it would get better but it did not .
the repeated sex scenes was boring i even found myself skipping several parts and just getting frustrated and in a bad mood !
i am listening to the audio version of this book and want to let people know what i find greatly annoying .
as a youngster , i loved the chronicles of narnia , so it is with some regret that i have to say this book is awful .
rather it just was not spectacular because it 'd already been done .
i supposed one might even accuse me of the same thing in my writings .
there was no interesting conversation .
i am a big fan of urban fantasy , and i bought this book because the plot sounded interesting and most of the reviews were really positive .
the reason : i did n't care about any of the characters .
i felt very disappointed she went in that direction .
i ended up really dissapointed .
again , it certainly is n't the worst book i have ever read , but it is n't very good either .
it felt like the author did n't know what else to do with them .
this one is offensively bad and to make matters worse , you 're forced to read it all to keep up with the tales of the gunslinger .
anyone that can decipher the information in this example of an excessive book does n't need the book .
the characters were unlikable and uninteresting .
i need to start reading the reviews . the characters were too unbelievable for me to dislike .
nor are any of the characters either interesting or sympathetic .
i could never really figure out the plot .
too similar .
as she would say in this book , it was like so annoying .
this is not a bad book ; but it is a slow read .
an example : " i 'm digging the view and yet not .
i could not believe it as i progressed into the story .
the social agenda felt forced , and i thought the author used her story as a pulpit for her views .
he ignores that these were written by religious for religious , and is presumptuous and arrogant to assume that the entirety of these saints ' writings is not important .
i do n't have an axe to grind in this case .
the sex was also a total snooze .
i do n't know if you could tell , but i thought this book was kind of awful , which really disappointed me .
it was boring and silly at times .
you can literally skip chapters and not miss a beat .
it felt rushed , like the author had simply exhausted himself to a point where he wanted out of his own story .
the author struggled to keep past characters lovable and failed .
unfortunately , my edition had none of this and the result was fairly implausible .
the clothing descriptions are scant and offer little insight ; the characters do not ascribe to any specific morals or slang of the era .
i did n't feel like i got real closure .
the storyline just did n't feel finished . don't waste your money .
but he 's a name who 'll sell .
sadly i am in agreement with the majority of those who found this book to be ... well , awful .
unfortunately , if this book is anything to go by , her talent does not extend to full length novels .
the sex scenes were way too drawn out , and the ending was anticlimactic ( pun intended ) .
found this to be heavy on statistical data rather than action planning content .
it 's hard to recall when last i read a novel with so many unlikable characters .
i am very happy that i did not buy this book , as it was very boring .
they 're all fairly well messed up , self absorbed , neurotic or otherwise damaged .
perhaps under such naturalism objective values do not exist .
i do n't think it ( or the author ) knows .
i 'm sorry because i really wanted to like this book but i did n't and i ca n't recommend it .
i feel let down by the ending to this storyline .
this book had great potential ..... but i think it failed .
this book did n't really work for me .
but i 'm not holding out much hope .
the plot is muddy , the switching povs are confusing , the characters are poorly developed and the ending renders the entire series pointless .
as i write this review i am slowly pushing this sad joke for a book towards the edge of my desk right where the trash can is waiting below .
i 'm afraid that completely ruined this book for me .
i would not accept a student in citing this material in their research .
not very stimulating ... or even believable .
i simply could n't suspend my disbelief .
people arguing and acting like jerks is n't entertaining to me . throw in a couple of ho - hum , unrelatable human protagonists and the book just does n't work .
it 's a " reverse sting " kind of thing , but there 's no tension or real struggle here . why ?
no reason why he has to be so rude and inconsiderate . also , the writing seemed too choppy .
the book was poorly written with too little detail of events and actions .
it was really obvious and distracting to me .
it seems like the author was trying waaaay too hard .
i tried to read fatal burn when it came out and could n't .
not worth the time or the money to buy it used .
this was n't a bad story idea but it was very poorly written .
i do n't think this book will be finishing the pregnancy with me .
if she does n't understand a young child , can i then believe the rest of her story - telling for any kinds of accuracy ?
does nt the author know wearing fur is a form of animal cruelty ?
obnoxious .
with unsympathetic characters , there has to be some way to engage the reader in their lives .
if you notice the writing , the book is n't well written .
be better off hopping into a taxi to the airport . save yourself , pick something else .
as an avid non - fiction reader , the content seems trivialized and i do n't find the characterizations entertaining , or even interesting .
perhaps i 'm just having trouble remembering , what was , for me , an unremarkable read .
were i a " cricket junkie , " perhaps i might have found this book of passing interest for that reason .
ca n't believe i actually paid for this one .
and i could n't get past the pretentious writing .
this book is simply absurd and overdone .
and i obviously ca n't trust the reviews any more since this book had very positive ones .
i did n't care for the young woman this book portrays .
a bit of plot forced in from time to time does n't save it .
it 's very misleading .
in the meanwhile , please do your child a favor and find something else for them to read .
when did this happen ? ? "
it did n't get me hooked and i skimmed over the pages most of the time .
things jumped around with no connection .
this book is insulting to women .
she , at least , had her main character get up and do something .
at that point however , the author apparently found god and begins to preach .
i do n't care why he does what he does , and i do n't care how much he ways or which of his personalities is doing what at what time .
i was left disappointed that i could't suspend my disbelief that this story could have actually taken place as it did .
do promoting authors really have that much free time ?
i , however , found it extremely depressing and frustrating to read .
i was intrigued by the concept but the ending was a cop - out . i found the characters to be stereotypical , simplistic and unbelievable .
it was the same thing page after page after page .
i did n't enjoy it very much , but this was an extremely breezy read , even for a slow reader such as me .
the story seems to move forward despite any of his actions ( or inaction ) .
instead , we die in , .
some interesting stuff does happen , but as a whole it was disappointing .
not just black and white , but many other colors here ( i , for one ) .
this is intellectually dishonest creationism hiding behind a cloak of scientific - sounding jargon .
there was a lot of factual information but little detailed description of application ie the content of dialogue in case studies .
she put her own needs ahead of her husband and children , and i was hoping that her husband had found out .
i found this " narrative " technique of storytelling to be an infuriating distraction .
this book offers no objective evidence for its claims .
the details of planning the funeral , which were completely irrelevant to the story , were boring .
whatever his intentions , he failed miserably . the plot is boring and without action .
and the end is supposed to stun the reader , but it only nauseated me .
i do n't want to include any spoilers , so will not beef about the unsatisfying ending .
i bought this book because the idea of " off the grid " interests me a little .
i wish i was the type that could stop reading garbage once i start a book because it was quite obvious early on .
each of these sections repeats the same basic information . the book did pick up a bit in the final section .
at times the dialogue was so atrocious that i laughed .... i am yours john , take me ..... is an example of actual lines .
that was not it either .
i started skipping pages and trying to find another interesting part and would start reading again at a new chapter but it 's just more monotony .
the dialogue is bizarre .
i tried to stick with it but i found myself yawning alot !
i was disappointed in the quality of this book .
i did n't say that very well .
the dialogue is ghastly and the description is nonsensical .
there was even a film made about it , but it 's not rated very well online .
i felt no emotion for any of them .
i looked again at the name of the author and then it came to me .
while many of the characters seemed like nice people , most of them lacked depth .
even though it is not described in excessive detail , it came up way too much to not have your mind go there .
i liked the main character because she was real and genuine but the writing itself was indeed amateurish and at times , just bad .
i hate chocolate !
honestly , there was so much going on that i found myself lost for much of it .
too biblical oriented .
it even started out promisingly .
while there is a bibliography , there is a lack of references .
instead , it should merely read " history of probability " which may shy some readers like myself away .
i had a hard time liking the author .
did any of the characters really stir up any tangible care and concern ?
neither believable nor satisfactory .
this book has either been rushed into print , or simply rushed .
it just seemed so formulaic ( is that a word ?
there is ?
then it just goes down hill from there .
but that does n't seem right for a vampire book .
there is really absolutely no point in buying this since it 's just in depth description of each map .
so bad , in fact , that i could n't even get midway through it .
his prose was too boring for my taste .
it 's as if he pulled out all of the scraps from his garbage and stuck them in a book .
the apple did not fall far from the tree .
the hero was too stupid to live .
i just tried to read this book but i had to put it down .
is n't this why we pay large sums for history books ?
i agree with the other low reviews that this book is vulgar and has gratuitous violence .
most , if not all , of the people she worked with and wrote about do not have this type of support .
it 's the lack of development and resolution that makes this a tough one to muster the interest to finish .
she 'd stopped by to tell me they would n't be around and i essentially said , ' yeah , well , you 're taking me . '
that gets tiresome .
why i continued reading , i&#8217;m not totally sure .
i was disappointed in the book , and would n't recommend that any one buy it .
and the lead character is a really seedy lawyer who would n't know an ethical standard if it ran over him - which it likely will at some point .
i think a major part of the problem was the writing , which i found clumsy and awkward .
it 's not just a bad investment , it takes money out of the economy and away from job creation .
not too long ago he was selling another diet plan and that is when he loss his weight .
i checked this book out of my local library , and am very glad i did n't buy it .
the author would ' tell ' rather than ' show ' plot points , which seemed amateur and got annoying .
" " i wanted to make an angry comedy about an economic system that i believed to be unfair and unjust . "
i 'm taking the kid back to the store to get my refund .
let 's talk about vacations .
the plot wanders aimlessly , the character development is rather limited and the ending is weak .
this is unfortunately totally lacking .
otherwise , the title has to be renamed to match the contents .
unfortunately , i ca n't give that recommendation .
it is very choppy with a lot of fluff and not much substance .
quite frankly , i want my money back .
save yourself the headache .
is it tiresome ?
i have to admit i skipped quite a few pages , and i just wanted to know how everything ended .
i 'm hoping that 's what happened with this book .
if you like logic , i suggest either borrowing it from a friend or avoiding it entirely .
was so boring , unrealistic , stupid .
if space was a problem he could have eliminated the chapter of " players " .
it was the mother of all disappointment for me !
i would not recommend you waste your time on this very poorly written and boring book .
unfortunately i did n't make it to the end .
his arrogance , his sex appeal , his charisma ... gone !
" religion is a fundamentalist delusion .
the book is pretty much outdated by now .
unless women stand up and ask for one . "
i could nt finish it because it was sooo boring .
i would not recommend this book to anyone ; it will only cause myths to be perpetuated and perhaps worse .
they spend the rest of the chapter ( a good number of pages ) trying to figure out just why it is that this connection is there .
which is not an ending by any definition .
oh , okay , he kills the guy . "
this one really did n't need to exist .
this book was so horrible i literally could not finish the ending .
this much hyped book was a disappointment .
but if you are after some good travel writing , look elsewhere .
i was so dissapointed to know that that was in fact the big mystery .
the characters are sort of annoying .
however , nowhere in the dvd or book does he teach about the movement of chi the body , its pathways or its functions .
however recently i have started to use other authors ' books and started to like them even better .
the lines cliche , the discourse was off - it was just bad .
did not finish it .
but it so similar to the last one , very little new major plot work , lots of repeats of small plots .
babies hate that kind of inaccuracy .
the writing rambles all over the place , like he is thinking off the cuff and did n't bother to get his thoughts in order .
i also found the writing simplistic and the suspense was not developed - it never seemed to keep my interest anyway .
i do n't care for his narration , but he just seems to get all the audiobooks i want to read .
what do all of the worst cities have in common ?
suspension of disbelief is totally trashed .
the summary sounded intriguing , but it was the exact opposite .
mediocre effort .
this story is readable , but nothing more .
either way , if a topic is that unclear , someone should have done more editing .
to save you some time and money , i can quote a few lines and you 'll have the entirety of the substance of this book .
despite this , she spends a huge amount of her time obsessing about how much she loves this guy .
not a great plot or well written .
( and why do people write reviews like they 're book reports ?
i am glad i borrowed it and did not spend any money on this book .
you killed off a major character with no rhyme or reason and it ends in a couple of pages ?
it 's not real anime or manga for that matter .
what i found was that i had not mis - read history , i just had not thought of it in the terms the author uses .
if you 're an adult , you should think twice before buying .
it only wastes space .
she writes like a poorly educated junior high student .
another disappointing effort by connelly .
poor thing is too proud to tell her nephew that she is cold and hungry and he thinks she steals because she 's going senile .
if you do n't know metal and want to learn something about the genre , do n't buy this book because you will be mislead .
too often articles or books written by economists are couched in arcane verbiage and statistics .
it dragged on so slowly and was completely boring
i 'm getting bored just thinking about the book as i write this review .
but maybe the power of rationality is n't in the writing .
however , this was an absolute disappointment ! ! !
they seemed to have connections with the main characters , but nothing grew from it .
just your typical man lusting after a woman ; man takes woman to bed , blah , blah , blah ......... even the sex scenes are so predictable .
did someone order a pizza ?
i 'm sure that i am not the only reader to have this thought .
it 's amazing how low the office of the presidency was brought by this flim - flam man , but the author misses the point entirely .
it 's also a little dated at this point , but that was n't too bad .
it 's not balanced , and it does n't pretend to be , but it 's pretty entertaining .
i wanted to be done with it that badly .
i do n't mind mention of drinking , drugs , swearing etc .
perhaps he needs to give it a rest ?
but i believe scripture requires us to be more discerning and careful in this matter .
i was bored and disappointed .
life 's short , do n't waste your time reading this .
if you 're only looking for sex & gore , then this might be up your alley .
it did n't feel like something that warranted a hard cover .
could n't you have been a bit more original ?
sadly , his " truth " was a borderline suicidal despair .
very predictable , full of logic holes , and a flying car to boot .
and what world - building there is , is vague or confusing .
i had looked into both , but was n't satisfied with the answers i was getting .
some parts were funny , but mostly it was dry british humor with really stupid characters .
i wanted to like this novel , i really did , but i was just barely able to keep my eyes open long enough to reach the final page .
or was n't real ?
he 's the antithesis of stuffy .
writer used too many words to tell the story and it became muddled and confusing .
he 's terrible .
but i do n't get this book .
not just an abrupt halt but once they got together , the story lacked depth and for me , became difficult to relate to both in plot and characters .
ridiculous amount of useless jargon .
but this book should have been marketed for young people , not adult readers .
ok so she did not kill herself ?
unfortunately , when you find out who the ' bad guy ' is , none of the rest of the book makes sense .
the characters are dull , without a life and totally unrealistic .
our book club agreed this was a boring and dull read , some members could not even finnish it , we do not recomend .
a scattered , disorganized disappointment .
and then she dismisses a rape as not being a rape ?
a phone book of forgettable stereotyped characters pad this short story to book length .
if you like a filthy read then this is the book for you , otherwise i 'd say skip it .
the stories were rather bleak .
actually no amount of evidence can convince someone who does nt want to believe , no matter if he is a skeptic or believer .
he only got halfway through .
nothing ! ]
unfortunately , there is nothing new in all of this- it is the common fodder in books of this subject matter .
too many good books out there to force myself to keep reading one that was n't .
i really feel disappointed .
i pushed myself to read this extremely long book that utterly failed to deliver .
others raved about the book leading me to think perhaps i 'd missed something so i rented the movie and watched it ( or at least i tried ) .
i have no idea what the book is really about .
ok , author and editors take heed !
this was unnecessary , as the content treads over some pretty basic and well know advice .
if you want a good mystery , then go somewhere else .
but it ended up being something i had to force myself to finish because i did n't really care about any of the characters .
i would check .
or something similar , king states .
it 's not really a bad book , but it does n't stand out at all .
it was really hard to follow .
the blurb made it seem more interesting then i found it .
the only reason i 've given this one star is it 's impossible to give no stars .
the story is poor to begin with , and you have to overlook big plot holes from the beginning just to get into it at all .
this novel does n't approach that standard .
it just did n't move me or get me in anyway .
otherwise , this is not a book i would pass on to a friend unless you want to discuss how absolutely bizarre it was later .
besides i do n't want other characters love story forced on me half way in to book .
but it does n't have a good enough plot to qualify as a novel .
i suppose i am as dumb as the little boy but i honestly could see nothing worth being enthused about in this book .
the boss is a walking stereotype .
book was too long for the subject matter with a few too many side trips down memory lane .
but again , it just does not live up to it .
oh well , i 've been known to disagree with the majority before . the courtroom drama just did n't connect with me .
i just ca n't express how much it saddens me that such a fun series should become have evolved into such complete trash .
unfortunately , it did n't pull me into the story .
it might have been best if it had not been written at all .
otherwise there is just a lot more description than i cared for and very little mystery .
wise decision : i really would have hated to buy it .
here are some basic , general critiques of the author 's numerous points , but it is not exhaustive .
that 's the problem -- too much telling and not enough showing .
the short choppy chapters , the plot moved too quickly , and some of the dialog was just silly .
terrible characters .
not because it is a bad story , it is actually pretty good but way to slow for me .
i stopped reading halfway thru and went looking on internet for the conclusion of the book .
unfortunately the book just was n't written well enough to really get into these connections .
it did n't flow like the truth , it seemed to be " faking " a real life situation .
there were too many narrators going in too many directions without enough individual personality and depth .
unfortunately , i found the story a bit flat .
as a result it 's hard to care much about what happens to anyone .
this installment is flat .
um ... okay .
nor do i think that it requires aliens to show us the way , let alone when the author herself does n't conclude the tale !
it is a rather premature grab at some kind of shortcut - to - being - an - artist .
the plot is therefore wasted on them when it should be focused on something important .
sorry but i was a true fan and i am so disappointed .
to the people who said they stopped reading books and only read the bible now , have you stopped ever listening to someone teach or preach ?
i feel bad .
why do outdated reviews appear on a newer release ?
i liked other books by this author , but did not enjoy this one very much .
the simplistic plot , the poorly drawn characters , the dialogue all screamed to me that this was not a book for adults .
the couple talks about little else . and shea is equally irritating .
this book was way too predictable .
this one just left me blank .
her sudden attachment to the children is never realized - just happens .
why does one have to wear a shirt and tie just to be a decent human being ?
however , the sex scenes here are so out of place that are really impossible to read .
i 'm trying to get there but it 's a long way off and books like this might do more harm than good .
my guess is the story will work better in those more visual mediums where story is less paramount . characters ?
accepted as such , the book is a success , if rather superficial .
it 's not a problem that we have " experts " spewing all sorts of nonsense and confusing everyone in our society about what is and is n't science ?
this guy is not a writer .
maybe i 'm wrong but ... anyway , to the book .
" did christ die only for the elect ? "
it is ultimately a forgettable novel .
so many times i was like alright i get it just get to the point already !
i ca n't say much more other than this is very disturbing .
what really annoyed me about this one is that the issues between the heroine and her sister in law were constantly repeated .
admittedly , she is n't either .
great service , pretty steamy book - i did not like this book - maybe i would like the trilogy but i thought it was kind of juvenile .
there is no closure .
as for as short stories go , this was horrible !
most of the dialogue in this novel is stilted , hokey and unbelievable .
this is , to put it mildly , an odd approach for an allegedly scholarly argument . as for positive criticisms , where should i begin ?
but this book is just boring .
the writer skipped around a lot .
i 'd use this book for extra toilet paper , but not for reading again . this book is useless .
no argument there .
i found the language slightly offensive .
it is not literature , not a novel or real trilogy in a literary sense .
? ridiculous .
i felt like i was wasting my time and could n't wait until this book was over .
it makes it seem as though this book had no purpose . overall i 'm just disappointed , but for the price , it could have been much worse .
( i would not recommend the e - version , however , and perhaps a well - edited version would 've allowed me to enjoy it more . )
and maybe i 'm just not girly enough for it .
if it was n't a library book , it would have ended up in the trash .
i was really looking forward to reading this book , but was sorely disappointed .
i would perhaps give the author another try , but this book ended up being a disappointment for me .
it had the potential to be a good story but it never made it there !
it comes apart about halfway through .
a very bland pictorial scrapbook of those jet - set ladies from the past .
there 's no joy in reading it , and the characters are not likeable .
the only reason i did this was to see how he would finish it .
i could care less about the characters and the poor kid , can there be a bit more substance to his self absorbed family members ?
she 's a snotty character : selfish , arrogant , annoying , and yes ... bitchy .
but no , what it really is it 's more neurological stuff , brain strokes and a lot of medical terminology .
we should all be so lucky . i'd also like to point out that the writing style in this book is tedious .
will not buy the other books in the series .
the other characters are n't well - developed or fully - formed , and i could n't develop any real interest -- or belief -- in any of them .
on one hand she was so contained that she became uninteresting .
) , but for the rest of us , skip it .
but i 've already done that , several times over , and i really did n't need to vicariously experience all that again .
it gets to the point where you 're really tempted to just skip it over and say ' yeah , i know . '
i advise you to skip it .
this book had potential , but mostly this potential went unrealized .
this was a total waste of my time and money , please do nt waste yours , one of the most boring stories that i have tried to read .
while there was attempt at humor , it fell short .
i have to agree with another reviewer .
it was mostly just about someones life history .
i just ca n't get interested in that kind of character involved in a plot made up of random events .
somewhat jumbled storyline - very predictable .
i was kind of disappointed because i thought the plot line was very good , but the execution was terrible .
the author went on about mundane details that were n't necessary .
aggressively unhelpful ; meandering , rambling style with terrible jokes , terrible prose , and worst of all , a dearth of actual practice lessons .
it seems as if it was written just because it could be .
i am wondering how dumb she thinks her readers are that she has to repeat the same facts over and over and over .
supposedly , it 's the zombie genre book to read , but i 'm not convinced that is true .
-- but that was a long time coming and not very interesting at that !
this book held no appeal whatsoever for me , other than the subject matter .
honestly , the point of a club is so that it 's somewhat exclusive .
lack of interesting plot .
it just was n't .
such pretty cards , such lame insight !
i should also say that the book is poorly organized .
there was no romance only lust as far as i could tell .
do n't think small . "
it was pretty much excruciating from beginning to end .
unfortunately , our present is only interesting to future historians .
i apologize in advance to those who adore this book and admire the author 's cleverness and facility with " playing " the reader .
i did n't care for teh old man or the kid .
unfortunately , this one seem to have taken a ridiculous turn into the twilight zone .
i was told repeatedly i had a personality shift when reading the book .
not that it was easy to pay attention to the story when i 'm cringing at every poorly constructed paragraph , but no .
i just could n't get grabbed by anything , which is very rare for me .
it 's as if the author changed focus and became bent on getting as gross and disgusting as possible .
the need to promote for diversity rather than for work performance ?
essentially , buy this if you need more paper for your bird 's cage , or have run out of tp .
it 's cheeky and funny .. but this books big problem is that the plot is to thin .
i usually order w e b griffin books before they are published .
just not my sort of book i guess .
not worth the money or the effort to finish the book .
however that is where the positives end .
what a horrible book for kids .
only i just could n't bring myself to .
my guess is that the vast majority of people can barely read of have such low comprehension levels that they feel like they have accomplished something when finished .
if the author wanted peace and peace means living with no joy being expressed , then i guess she got what she wanted .
some of her stories are [ mildly ] entertaining , but there seems to be a lot of padding .
i do n't feel that happened here .
i found this book to be poorly thought out .
i read the reviews and figured it would be a ripping read even if a little superficial .
he must be cool , too , given his fondness for interjecting the word " effing " on many pages . but that 's about it .
she not only wrote it ; she is its main and only star , assisted by a few bit players .
i just could n't be bothered to continue . the characters did n't engage me .
her characters do n't sound like they are mature adults , but often sound more like teens vying for attention .
do n't fall for the hype .
great premise for a book but poor execution of the idea .
this story was very slow getting started and even after it did it jumped from perspective with little warning or guidance .
it was true disappointment .
however the version i received did not have the card game or access to the " interactive " website .
not much else to say
i did n't identify with the main character much .
it started off great but i think the author did not know how to finish .
worse than where they came from , i guess .
countering all of her bad ideas and false assertions would require a column longer than her book .
i just did n't " get " him and what we do know about him is n't believable - some wannabe gangster type - no substance .
i found myself skimming the pages and still am not sure how she resolved all the loose ends .
he throws tantrums .
cheating ruins people 's lives , and it is dishonest that the author makes it seem as though everything works out in the end .
i could not get into it at all .
maybe that was push here , but it was distracting to say the least . on the plus side , i liked the idea of keeping an ' angel journal ' .
it felt overly simplistic , predictable in places , stereotypical in others .
no you do not .
i would give this less than one star if i could .
the author 's books about the no .
the modern characters , in the parallel plot , are no more real and are only marginally less simplistic .
no loose ends tied up .
characters were n't just 1-dimensional , they were totally flat .
it was confusing in parts .
or perhaps i simply missed the point somewhere while the repetitive dialogue was lulling me to sleep .
this book was n't bad .
the horribly cheesy aphorisms that are sprinkled throughout this book make it difficult to take seriously .
but it just did n't ever capture my interest or attention .
instead of a letter in the middle of a word .
but now suddenly she grows this overbearing conscience that does n't let her enjoy her time with shay because she might - kinda - maybe still feels something for ren .
events seem contrived and exaggerated , if not downright fabricated .
a disappointing ending to a wonderful series .
update : check out this review ; [ ... ]
there are probably much better books , do n't bother reading this , you wo n't learn anything new .
it 's as though the author had n't really thought things out to the end before writing .
sorry i quit reading it as i did not like it .
c'mon are you kidding me ?
this book however was disappointing and at times even depressing .
that was n't long enough .
thank goodness that i downloaded it from the library instead of buying it ... that is my only consolation .
so not true in my opinion . this review was originally posted to [ ... ]
there were times when he became genuinely frustrating .
she did what ? "
it is easy reading , not requiring any real thought and very predictable .
inane characters and an insipid , vapid plot .
poor editing hurt the content , the poorer photos should have been left out and the better ones enlarged .
" original sin does not refer personal guilt but to the sinful condition in which and into which human beings are born . "
it was very painful to read .
" sorry , but there are too many good books out there to praise this one .
i join the ranks of those that can not give this book rave reviews .
it felt rushed yet parts of it dragged .
to deny emotion is to engage in absurd narcissism .
i was looking forward to this book , but after finishing it i was disappointed .
but the writing is bland , predictable , flat , and the characters are created by the numbers .
but , if you were hoping for some romance , forget it .
presumably they are meant to help sell the novel as the basis for a screenplay .
i found it to be so mixed up and i just could not get into the book .
i could n't get into the story and i usually try and finish every book i read .
he is very abusive and has bad habits like doing drugs and drinking and is a bad influence .
maybe getting writer 's block would be a good thing for king ...
but , what was suppose to be in " real time " just was rambling and , more times than not , uninteresting .
he says he does n't care that she 's a vampire .
if you are expecting imaginative writing and insights , you will be disappointed .
if a new author tried to submit this book for publication , it would not be considered good enough to even secure a literary agent .
the problem is that the plot resolution in each book seems to come later and later , with fewer and fewer pages being devoted to it .
honestly i would give this book no stars if that were possible .
but he mentions also that he could n't replicate it in front of others .
it is like trying to drink from a cup while someone is tipping the other end .
i read others comments saying they liked this book and others saying it was okay .
i guess he was just trying to push his very crappy book .
but while these facts are interesting enough , his words and his actions are pretty hum drum . overall , this book ( and the hero ) lacked dash and humor .
but ultimately , it reads more like a short fanfic expanded to book length instead of a story that could have actually been part of the show .
and the story is awful . things start well enough .
i never received it as it is not in my kindle and never has been .
say no to the publishers so called agency sales model and ridiculous over priced ebooks .
the use of quotation marks , or rather the lack thereof , had me so confused sometimes as to whether the character was thinking to himself or actually speaking aloud .
they feel human and humanity feels mundane . for much of the book , nothing really happens .
we wondered at the purpose of the book .... was there one ? ?
the book is not only cheap and cheesy -- it 's insultingly unbelievable and ill - imagined .
do not waste your money or time
i would like to go more in - depth about this plot , but quite honestly , that 's really all there is to the plot .
i read the first three chapters and i just couldn't get into it .
the fact is that they have never been tried .
forced myself to keep going to see if it got better , it did n't .
i wanted it to be !
very simplistic story line lacking originality .
this book is rambling and wordy .
i did like the characters , but they also lacked a certain amount of legitimacy .
i check the books out of the library .
it was like she just gave up instead of finishing the story .
after repeatedly complaining aloud , " this just is n't funny . "
there was too little dialogue .
the focus was so much on that and i could n't quite understand why does that honestly matter ?
it was a poorly thought out .
i wish the author luck , but i 'm not going to read anything else by the man .
just a pretty dumb book .
they might have separated and got back together ... but i do n't quite trust the author as an expert authority on famous people 's lives .
if the husband is laid off , there is no safety net of income .
this is a poor choice even as a freebie .
no one could be out in that land without water on them if they are walking a distance .
why not be honest with your readers ?
history may be decided upon but suspense novels should create the illusion that anything is possible . even the small details of the subplot fail to find resolution .
i shrugged it off and though perhaps it was another typo .
i would definitely not recommend this !
i got bored and really could n't bond to the characters .
it was completely awful .
to me she just seemed to constantly whine and complain .
horrible . i want my money and time back .
i tried to read it but the conversations that these people have bore me to tears .
the female made a new decision and the male went along with it , but there were no real changes in character and the story was n't at all believable .
i found myself losing interest more and more , then even skipping portions as they seemed to have no relevance to the plot .
thin plot , mostly stock characterizations , and a rushed ending .
there is just nothing new in this book i did think i may learn something new , but to no avail .
the dad is portrayed as a dumb cave man whose only desire in life is if he can have sex with his wife .
i was expecting more personal details ( autobiography ) .
simply said , it was a boring book for the most part .
why does anyone want to waste their time on reading a book about ordinary people being horrible ?
they have to find * something * to sell to generate income .
there was strength in her at the beginning that i thought might be the redeeming factor for the book .
but why does he think that ?
i 'm angry at the fools who have elevated this pile of trash to high status and foisted it upon the unsuspecting masses as " literature .
i found that the bad writing made this book hard to enjoy .
otherwise , avoid it like the plague .
the main premise of the world is that it is very sexually free .
ultimately , while i found this book engaging enough , i was disappointed too .
this is misleading .
( however , i did n't finish it , so perhaps it all would have come together in the end . )
the book is simply too short to thoroughly cover what needs to be covered to support his thesis .
someone who is so focused on said price that not only does he ignore anything that would reduce his chances , but someone who bases fundamental career decisions on it .
he fails , however , to really get our attention , not really taking a stand as he also points out the upside of family and fellowship during the holidays .
unfortunately , the book devolved into a lot of preaching .
not really !
i 'm really getting tired of these writers who are really writing adolescent romance novels under the guise of fantasy , horror or science fiction .
the comic book equivalent of " extreme " sports .
for someone like me with a small kitchen , this additional hard - to - store equipment tends to be a non - starter .
reads like a fiction novel . this book has some " entertainment value " , if i may put it as that .
it just seemed that he wanted to let her know about the spear and discuss a way to get it back to her .
i 'm angry i wasted the money on it and could n't erase it off my reader fast enough
i could not understand why the writer which has talent decided to put in all the " kinky " sex .
i do n't bother to write many reviews .
i do n't really have time to read it .
i just did n't see the depth of their love besides some kind of physical attraction , but i guess , maybe i might just be a cynic .
the narrator is obnoxious , self - centered , and completely tone - deaf to social situations .
* * * huge spoiler alert * * * um .
many times i had to double and triple check that i did n't skip a page because things altered so quickly that i had no idea what was going on .
you would also then be disappointed .
after completing the diet , i had not lost any weight .
( and really not edgy .
there is just too much here about these losers .
no documents or arguments which actually outline a coherent anti - abortion position are considered .
out of a sort of necessity there were no quotation marks , because so much of the book was dialogue .
could have been just as good of a book without the offensive language and constant references to sex .
did not like this book , the writing style was very difficult to follow .
there 's no explanation .
" he was being logical , and she was having none of it .
disappointing read , the author repeats verse throughout and there is no flow to the script or structure .. a feel good book that just did not work for me ...
there is n't anything wrong with this book , except that it did not capture my attention .
a shield ... the dumbest and most cheesy idea of a power ever .
this is a poor written book that could have been better !
this will not be much of a review .
if you 're looking for a good vacation read , i 'd have to advise you to look elsewhere .
the plotting , at times , seemed contrived to make a point and character development was seriously lacking .
i 've never seen a cookbook so poorly bound .
so , i tried to read this book .
the books is essentially a collection of random factoids .
it did n't even logically follow through on the plot points because many points were negated repeatedly .
but his book is very disappointing .
i also felt that the author had a some big ego issues .
the sex takes up chapter after chapter .
can not believe the end gives credit to researchers as it was so poorly done .
seemed almost like a supermarket tabloid version of history .
i could n't finish this book because the overblown jargon turned me off .
but none of this stuff is in there !
this book lacks detail and is short .
i made it halfway through the book , but no further will i go .
overall sub - par
the plot was ridiculous , and the execution was nauseating .
did n't draw me in at all .
sorry - but it was horrible !
scenes that could have been graphic and made the story more interesting were skimmed over .
there are way too many characters and too many subplots .
or is he just mouthing them ?
that 's not why you marry someone .
i am not at all one to bash an author or her books , so this is not my intention .
not horrible other than i did n't get the daddy question answered .
i enjoyed the fact that the heroine was blonde with blue eyes , but i did n't like how much the author seemed to be in love with her .
surely , i do n't dislike this author as much as i think i do .
not to say it is n't good or that is filled with heresy , it just does n't offer much in the way of new perspectives .
now the omissions caused by writer 's shallow understanding of tactics and strategy are glaring ( mobile defense ?
but while they may grasp it , they still can not explain it , not even conceptually .
but the execution had me begging for an end , and it was too long and too confusing and too underdeveloped for me to sit through .
it never really goes anywhere and the & # 34;story&#34 ; is beyond predictable .
i would not waste my time reading this book !
i personally find this more insulting than praise - worthy . without spoiling the end , there is no character development .
their kisses were boring , they had no passion at all .
it does not state from where .
however , while overall i was pleased with the story , it had too many plot holes , and a villain with no redeeming qualities .
every problem is described in the most extreme language .
another error .
notably , the parts of his performance that i did n't like were also the parts of the story that i did n't like .
the worst part of this book was the ending or lack of ....
she was the worst !
if it was n't for book club , i may have stopped reading .
however , they did bake out almost like the picture ( all pictures are black and white , by the way ) except mine were not as round .
pretty predictable .
stupid ending .
in summary , this book was awful .
it is such a dishonest practice and reviewers need to be aware is happening .
i felt it was unnecessary and a very cheap way to end the story .
the " war " feels forced and the descriptions dry .
but the examples were either old , or barely relevant events in the author 's life .
no spoilers , just my opinion : it was n't great .
oh , the premise is interesting .
it was probably meant to be simply dramatic , but it was overdone and came out being a bit ridiculous .
i wo n't be reading any more books in the series and i would n't suggest this book to anyone else either .
so to sum it all up , it was a boring book that made a futile attempt to make the reader evaluate faith .....
i think the writing is poor , and i guess i just do n't get the hype .
the mystery here was pretty weak and there was almost no backstory on the victim , so i really did n't care if he was dead .
i did enjoy some of the descriptive material about the regional setting , but it just did n't carry the load for me .
if you still want to read this book ( i know many will find it hard to believe it could be so bad ) take it out from the library .
was expecting to curl up with a comfortable read , but i was a little disappointed .
i got so sick of her hypocritical comments that i frequently just found myself skimming her lines until something better came along .
no spoilers , but i wanted to say the ending of this book was annoying as hell .
the main character was not likable and unbelievable .
she 's not wrong .
however , this book was not engaging at all .
however that seems to have been done .
this is probably my mistake since the cover should have been a clue .
even though i had not read any of the previous novels in the series i was hoping it would pull me in & compel me to read the rest .
the story starts out with a band of brothers over - punishing a slow - witted neighbor for a crime allegedly committed against their sister .
however , this book sucks .
although parts of this book are very good , i found the book to be very depressing overall . i had a hard time reading this book and finishing it .
i was not that far into the book that i literary slammed the cover shut and threw the book across the room !
in this case , i would probably never say that " the book was better than the movie . "
the " study " was based entirely on anecdotes from her clinical work with a few troubled adolescent girls - hardly representative of the broader population as it purported to be .
i was n't sure of his .
this was not a hit and we probably wo n't play it again .
complete self adulation . but the fault is entirely mine .
the description of the characters is extremely vague .
but there were still a lot of things that bother me about the characters .
it 's as if the author did n't know how to end the book and just got tired of it and wrote something down .
it became tedious and boring .
the book has n't been edited .
it is not a light read .
i got so tired of reading " why do you hate me " or " what have i done to make you hate me ? "
everything about the book , aside from the world - building , is trite beyond words ; this is juvenile , unimaginative , amateurish writing .
the sentences did n't flow very well .
the book is just not a very good read .
the silly situations were a real stretch .
the romance was disappointing , not long enough and not particularly interesting .
however , this book was a disappointment .
i found it boring and empty , trying to push a vampire theme because they think it 's still hot .
i 'm sorry , but this book is , simply put , not good .
which is basically what politics is .
not engaging .
the worst part is the revisionist description of how kindly most of the sailors treated natives , especially women .
there are several graphic sex scenes sprinkled throughout the book .
the book jumps around a lot , often leaving whole chunks of time unexplained .
apparently many readers agree with me .
i found this book difficult on multiple levels .
because this book was too whack .
i found this frustrating as a reader .
it has awful , foul language and awful characters .
on its own - as a novel geared for an younger audience and having an interesting story - this book is n't a bad read .
i found the time line to be confusing and the characters not developed , i had trouble caring what happened to them .
i am so sorry this book was written .
by injecting himself as the book 's main character .
if a book requires a cd , then it should be easy enough to locate that content on their site .
the kidnapper ( the " amateur historian " of the title ) confesses , just before he dies , that he has hidden the girl away but does n't say where .
the plot was thin and the characters were one - dimensional .
some of the dialogue and descriptions are quite graphic .
it was like someone i hardly know talking my ear off about people i do n't know .
is n't that better ?
someone decides to leave our main character black objects : cat , rooster , goat , etc , which is bad karma .
... but this book made me give up king for life .
in fact , i far preferred the excerpts of other books at the end .
there is nothing in the world like it- nothing .
i quickly grew tired of all the secrets and the constant memory loss , it became too repetitive to continue to hold my interest .
i hate to say it but i really felt this book was a waste of a perfectly good title , format , and idea .
ok , now onto my pros and cons of this book . cons : i felt like the characters were too self - absorbed about themselves .
because beneath the pretty cover there 's no real depth to the book , in either its so - called heroes and villains , or its alleged plot .
it seemed repetitive and went in circles a lot .
cliched dialogue , disjointed and often irrelevent plot lines , and characters i did n't care about .
i find it tiring and tiresome to read .
the detail of the combat engagement were very detailed , so much slow the reader begs for them to be over .
the fact i can get the audio version and not the e - book is a slap in the face to all us kindle readers .
at least as far as i got .
much of the book wanders about looking for a central theme , as if the author thinks he may have stumbled on one .
but his pain is no basis to preach heresy .
the plot reads like a teen soap opera with nothing realistic about any of it .
furthermore the author wants to blame historical events on meth .
if that does n't work , have other people say the same thing .
also , the story starts off really slow in the beginning .
not good would not recommend .
why does the author give the countries which sign these contracts a free pass ?
ca n't say do n't read it as maybe it got out of the hole , but i just got worn out with all the verbiage going nowhere .
was that part supposed to be funny ?
i enjoy her books ( except for her recent historicals which leave something to be desired ) .
given that i actually purchased the last couple and consider those a waste , i wisely chose to preview this one for free , courtesy of the public library .
very slow moving and rather dry .
what happens is entirely his fault , and i did n't sympathize much with him .
i need to be at least somewhat engaged .
these are anecdotes .
it left me wanting and i found the romance to be lacking in a big way .
too little story , to much junk , to the point of not being able to even finish the book !
there was nothing compelling about her .
too much detail .
i ca n't get past the total lack of editing .
i could barely make it past the sample .
the misunderstandings between the h / h were crazy stupid .
too lazy .
but perhaps she might consider slowing down , giving herself some time to develop and mature her writing .
of all of her books , i was very disappointed with this one !
not when the players keep taking questionable " supplements . "
disappointing , but , to each their own .
as others have said , i mostly skim - read it , skimming over the paragraphs to try to pull out the tidbits of interest .
this whole book is nothing but a big propaganda piece aimed at the segment of the public still enamored with her mother .
' if you ca n't eat 'em or f--- 'em , they 're worthless . "
if your into heavy content such as this , i believe you would really like this book .
which is to say , the propaganda flick nose - dived .
so when it happens here , why are we supposed to care ?
the writing style is poor , and if you want any sort of depth of the character to be developed look elsewhere .
is a girl liking a guy really that bad ?
the plot took forever to get going .
well , at first i did , even tho the main character was arrogant and boring .
but he is not an alpha - male .
all the drinking and other shenanigans by him and his " family " were very offputting .
no , it 's merely a poorly written zombie romp ... for children . and that 's what it all boils down to .
this book is n't based on hard evidence .
he drones on and on but what he 's saying does n't add to the story at all .
she seems to act almost at random , following her whims or doing whatever someone else tells her to do at the moment .
i honestly did n't know how to react .
that may be my problem as much as the novel 's , since i am an old yoga enthusiast with an old marriage , but other seniors might take note .
i seriously considered mailing the book back to the publisher , but i just threw it away instead , because the book is n't even worth the postage .
this is a very disappointing read .
the premise is a good one , but it fails to connect in a number of areas .
which is why it was sad that i had to agree with my friend - it was kind of boring .
do n't give up !
bad fiction at that
furthermore , for a novel that 's supposedly based on historical facts , the author gets many of them wrong .
it was such a disappointing ending to the series .
but i never found it .
" now , maybe i live on another planet or something - but this is not my experience .
let 's think ... whose interests does he serve ?
a bundle should save money , it 's the point of a bundle .
it 's probably a metaphor for something .
i left this book on a plane as an evil gesture to some unsuspecting traveler . do you like humor ?
do n't get taken the way i did .
the decent pacing here , and the briefest glimpses of the antagonists , served to create a sense of mystery that got me interested and engaged despite the thin writing style .
the writing occasionally makes slight jokes , but they 're rather lackluster .
any autobiography or memoir is intrinsically self - serving , and this rambling work is no exception .
why rob poor people ?
his logic is puzzling at best and the title of the book extremely misleading since it totally ignores basic research on how hiv is transmitted .
i had read the buy side and hoped this would be similar .
no surprises here -- too much time spent on brand names and boy friends , nothing much of interest in the characters or plotting to keep me interested .
but i just do n't like it .
i felt like it was a gigantic prologue , especially with the constant flashbacks .
i actually wound up skimming parts of the book in a semi - desperate attempt to see if it got any better .
the book had too much irrelevant information .
in this book however he deals with the question of intelligent design in a rather superficial manner without getting down to some really basic issues .
is n't there any happiness in this place ? "
this was not a book to love .
it is not attractive , not necessary , and not interesting .
characters are shallow and unrealistic .
did not look at " previously published " date or i would n't have bought it .
i ended up skipping scores of pages of disjointed narrative piled up with needless detail and felt i had n't missed a thing .
i 'm sorry to say this , but it felt as though the author was trying to cash in on the rising popularity in zombie fiction .
who acts like that ?
( no really , stop the press that 's printing this book , please . )
and discipline is n't something that can be applied for a while and then forgotten .
they were blocky and were no means acceptable .
with too much writing that seemed to have no relevance to the story , i found this story to be way too predicable .
i recommend not reading this book .
it 's just a basic paperback .
i 'm okay with the fact that the storyline is not a new idea .
i hate this .
was this women 's breast non existent ?
i was very disappointed , there were many times i did n't want to continue but needed to know what happened to the kids in the class .
i rather find him to write poorly , and his humor is , to me , vulgar and juvenile .
if you can just let everything go ( suspend your disbelief ) you might like this book better than i did .
this was an interesting story and unique premise , unfortunately the author has confused tedious writing with being suspenseful .
obviously this is something you need to take into account but it 's not everything .
then i decided that life was too short to force myself to read a book that totally bored me .
this had a weak plot , improbably motivation , superficial characters and just a bad book .
i was really disappointed , and put this book down several times for extended periods before coming back to it - i was that bored .
i 'm so sorry but i could n't read this boring book .
and i 'm not happy about it , either .
i was not thrilled with her style or her delivery .
here , he does his best to make it unreadable with a disjointed story that feels like he cut and pasted together unrelated stories and tried to make them fit .
) , but i found this mystery to fall below the mark in too many other respects .
instead , the authors use each case to generalize and offer suggestions .
this novel fails as both an entertainment and as a serious novel .
that is all . what i did not like : i rarely out and out hate a book .
" i am slow of speech and slow of tongue . "
very disappointed - wish i could get both my money and time back !
he lamented the fact that most authors seem to be doing it the other way around .
i normally enjoy stream of consciousness , but the writing was extremely meandering and repetetive .
what if he really just tried to make her a better student ?
it is probably the worst book i have ever tried to read .
oh and forget about the other books this guy wrote .
this book was , from start to finish , a muddled mess .
this had to be one of the most scattered , slow moving and boring books i have ever read .
this book was so poorly researched that it clearly shows just how much work was put into this novel .
why destroy so much of the work of previous writers and designers ?
i agree with other reviewers that it 's a just a long walk , punctuated by sex and ayla - is - a - miracle - worker episodes .
cardboard characters and an improbable plot .
but i totally hated the book .
i do not care for books that portray the leading female character in an on going state of ditzy .
there were way too many trite metaphors and descriptions .
i will not be buying the hardback .
i was disappointed enough in this outing between unlikeable characters and disjointed plot that i am not sure i will continue with the series .
it was the most tedious , repetitive , writing i have ever read .
why else would they take up valuable page space which could be spent fleshing out a world , which by coincidence is why i bought the book .
every character the same - obnoxious juvenile crass and rude .
and he claims that you feel " true " hunger in your throat ?
there was nothing .
this book was just ok for me .
" i did n't need any help with that , but this looks like something big .
boring and tedious .
i wo n't be reading anymore in the series unless they 're free .
this type of non - dialog between the characters made up the bulk of the book .
the ideas were too difficult for me to comprehend .
if not , then you 'll do best to skip it .
i found this book excessively dry and too detailed .
however , like others before me , do n't let this be your guide .
too many garbage ideas to mention here .
i could n't get past the beginning of this book .
i was not a fan of the writing in this book either .
i found a hardback at a bargain price , but it was still too much money for as short as the book is .
the author is great but did not like this book
that 's why i stopped reading it about halfway through . i know a lot of people have a hard time not finishing a book .
i found one issue with an ' its ' but that was all .
i wish i would 've listened to all the negative reviews and passed on this instead of wasting my time .
he does n't have one .
after those chapters the book pretty much ends .
the main characters lacked chemistry .
i just simply did n't connect with any of the characters .
most annoying phrase ever !
i just wish that a better representative of the male sex had written the counterpoint .
that chapter was coherent and i could follow .
- but i was really turned off by the snobbish attitude of the writer .
i will not pick up another issue of it .
boring , manner .
sorry , but this book was a waste of money .
that was so distracting and stupid .
it was boring and it had no story .
i thought that the story itself had some potential , but i thought it was very slow to develop .
it was a huge disappointment for this reader .
thankfully , when i downloaded this book it was free so i did n't waste money along with time .
this was the worst book i have ever read .
we get a kiss here and there but no real love scenes - which i could tolerate if either relationship felt at all real .
i liked the idea that the book was based on , but there is a complete lack of execution in making the story worth reading .
this book is the weakest book in the in death series , for a number of reasons .
much of it sounded unbelievable and far fetched .
& # 60;3 means a lot to me , even if i did n't enjoy the book .
unfortunately , the author does not provide enough information about the suspects for the reader to have a clue about the whodunit .
i pride myself on not giving up easily but had to bag out on this book after halfway point and i * never * do that .
they do not need to reduce prices when books are poorly written .
the scariest part , though , is the breastfeeding info , which directly contradicts research on the subject .
it 's also dragged out and is a long book as it is .
which is the story line here , no ?
this so called conspiracy they 're talking about was not important .
the characters were too underdeveloped .
in fact , i reacted so badly to all those depressing tales that i literally wanted this book to be out of my house as quickly as possible .
i have to say it : i was bored silly by this book .
i do n't believe that diversity or tolerance are bad and lead to immaturity , but the lack of critical thinking shows a lack of maturity .
i hope this does n't mean her other books will have characters like her .
i just do n't get the popularity of this guy .
this one does it in droves to the point where the story is totally distracting .
so boring ! !
there were no characters in this book to care about .
this just was n't something i found myself connecting to on a deeper level or really being able to suggest to people .
the story was mostly predictable , the characters one - dimensional and the writing inconsistent .
any short excerpt from the book reads well- it 's the cumulative effect of boring characters and inaction that bother me .
garbage ! ! !
even the other reviews i checked out did not warn me .
i was not a fan of the way this topic was handled .
hard to believe that this book won so many accolades .
no , do n't say that evidence does n't exist .
it was slow , did not keep me interested .
the formatting of this book is so bad that it 's impossible to read .
the characters are somewhat thinner than cardboard , the writing is childlike , and very , very bizarre .
and in the interest of full disclosure , i should tell you that i could n't finish it .
( to be fair , they could be interesting and perhaps the author just is n't that good at drawing that out .
started out promising and then fizzled badly .
this idea of pain equals artistic skill is forced down our throats for too many pages .
a sweet story in many ways , but it was frustrating to read through the main character 's stupidity .
it was not terrible and it was not great .
the plot just was to convoluted and boring .
it just left his character incomplete . there was too much unnecessary history which left me wading through a too much politics and not enough romance .
another problem was the unresolved plot issue .
this book went nowhere .
the characters were totally unappealing .
the cookie cutter , predictable plots in this book had me thumbing through a lot of pages .
try to get a sample few pages before buying this one .
the art is lacking , it 's not awful but it 's dull , stagnant and does n't hold a great visual appeal comparable to most good comic art .
so far the plot consists of an old bitter woman shutting herself off from the world and going on and on about the disappointments of her life .
the beginning of the story was slow , but kept my interest .
no more wasted time or effort for me with recipes that are barely more than preparation notes !
in other words , it 's less the brain - drain that 's the problem and more the sex - specificity of it .
with flat characters and a predictable plot , the negative reviews for the book are not surprising .
the story premise is ok , but the book is poorly written .
ugh ... this is really just the author 's religious ramblings , poorly disguised as a novel .
the author has not met a simile , metaphor , or adjective she did n't like , and they are all in this book .
it is made up of vague abstractions that morph into one another to create the appearance of an inference .
it was torturous .
i suppose i was expecting much more science , and perhaps that is just an indication of the gaps in dog research .
this is really just such utter rubbish .
instead , they are forced to deal with finished manuscripts that , well ... suck .
too little depth of character & plot & storyline .
it tries to deal with too many serious issues , but only manages to do it superficially .
do n't waste your time on this one unless you need something to help you sleep .
) my sister recommended this series , and i tried , i really did , but every page has flat and pathetic dialogue that makes me cringe .
again , as a theory , it has biblical support , it has dramatic potential , but the execution of such a thing is very doubtful .
i feel bad about it , but i just could n't do it anymore .
i barely got through it without throwing it out the window .
but it was also all over the map , and frequently contradictory .
so this whole other character business , is either , information that we 're supposed to understand , or a failed attempt and a change in character .
where is the sensual detail , the smell , taste , feel of falling in love , not just putting up with each other because of proximity ?
i tried to root for him but he made it so difficult with stupid decision after stupid decision .
the writer sure had a weird imagination .
" i want to eat vegetarian , organic , etc .
unless you 're a die - hard drizzt fan , stay away .
i do not plan on placing this book in my church library .
i actually great hopes for this book .
the pacing is muddled , the dialogue meanders , and irrelevant asides swell up in odd places . maybe the biography was right and his wife did the real writing .
he was too much .
this one was quite boring .
it is too long , not well developed characters , not well developed plots and subplots , and carelessly assembled .
the story was well written , but the overall feeling of the book was very sad .
my problem is that the story is really , really ridiculous .
this is n't funny , it 's just plain lame and grossly disgusting .
she distorts it all to fit her point of view .
it 's a handsome book , some recipes , a few pictures , just not what i expected ..... the truth is ..... i'm selling it in a garage sale .....
i generally enjoy sci - fi / fantasy novels , but could not get into this book .
i 'm not quite finished with the book ; i 'm just over halfway , but it has been a battle to get this far .
the mystery is convoluted but not particularly interesting .
i was disappointed in the end .
there is no progression .
what a disappointment this was !
does she think expressing an opinion or point of view might offend ?
the plot is simple and , unfortunately , predictable .
endless whining and angst and immaturity .
here 's why:1 ) the characters really are not that interesting .
i could n't get into the stories .
sorry to say i was very bored .
i thought it was not very well written .
i try and read both sides of any issue but this book is unreadable .
it was so bad , i was wishing that the heroine was positively wrong in her assessment of who killed her sister .
but that is not this book .
it was a drag to read .
i expected to love this book , but instead i am working hard to muster up civil feelings .
in the dark , using black plastic trash bags if your curtains are n't dark enough .
moreover , there are no other characters to connect with .
the climax was so ... it was so anticlimactic !
plot interesting but by the middle of this book i started rooting for it to end .
a very confusing story .
as a book , i just did n't like it .
this was so corny and ridiculous .
do n't waste my time !
to be frank , i felt like i was reading a piece of semi - decent fanfiction written by a teen .
did not keep at interest .
i 'm not spending more of my time writing a long review cause i wasted enough trying to read the book .
i would n't call this a romance or chick book in any way .
the editing errors alone keep me from taking it seriously .
that , too got on my last nerve .
this in itself would have been very interesting , but he does n't stop there .
if i did n't know that some folks would actually believe this silliness , i could laugh more at this book .
i have read most of his work and am very disappointed in this one .
maybe i am missing something .
apparently i missed that entire section because it was n't in my copy .
for example , you can spend a lot of time and energy blogging your brains out and never sell a book .
i struggled with this book because it did not go anywhere or tell me any details that the ordinary person did n't know .
not quite unreadable , to my taste , but very nearly so .
i wish i could see a better example in the other books so i do n't buy another old fashioned book like this one .
his writing style is wooden , mechanical , stiff , and dull .
quite honestly , i thought that the plot really ended up to be quite silly .
this story was silly and simplistic .
it had virtually no informational value as a book about politics .
their little " quirky " characters seemed so made up - it was as if everyone in the book was a caricature .
i thought so little of it i threw it in the trash instead of inflicting it on a friend as a gift .
i do feel like this book was a waste of money .
no character - development , no real narrative path .
however , the novel is dissapointing .
i did not get anything out of it though .
unfortunately , this book did n't grab my interest and it was pretty easy to figure out who did do it and why almost immediately .
her behavior made this book very difficult to finish .
i would never have guessed it was written by the same authors .
what a load of progressive , liberal crap !
then , something happened .
i would definately not suggest this or any other book in series for any child to read
however , the book was way too long so the story just seemed to stretch on and on ( and on ) .
making some fairly fundamental errors in plot and structure , but showing signs of promise - and there are signs of them .
i chose this book because of the glowing reviews .
they have enough struggles to be accepted on their merits without this kind of gnostic rubbish .
i hated the f - bombs dropped so frequently by more than just the main character .
i 'm on that machina seeking other authors .
however , she needs to come up with some different plot lines for the series because the novels have become predictable .
the whole thing .
that is his prerogative , but taking such an attitude means that his ideas will remain just that : ideas .
i did n't know that this book is a series of unrelated short stories ; had i known i 'd not have purchased .
stick with books that have recently been published and have more up to date information .
he would n't sweep a woman off her feet , but i think he 'd be pretty easy to live with .
she 's a pretty disgusting person and i 'm sorry now that i gave her money through the purchase of this book .
not to spoil the ending , but i do n't see how the murderer was able to overpower all these people and murder them ... just not believable .
actually if it was fast - paced , i would n't notice just how thin the characters are .
you will be too depressed to be active .
the fascination is however marred by what must be some of the worst writing i have ever encountered .
or do anything else that would n't directly cause a dangerous situation you have to repeatedly fix ?
she might as well have hung a sign on him saying , " hey , i am supposed to be prime suspect . "
many women would much rather focus on their career than bear children .
they all have the same basic plot ( a big problem with popular authors ) but the characters are usually well written and interesting .
ridiculously long and unrealistic monologues used to reveal the characters ' emotional states .
this book is also not for the layman reader .
how on earth the bad guys do n't know who she is , why she is n't taking advantage of her new powers , the comic book store ? ? ?
if i do n't , too bad , just move on to the next .
it 's hard to describe how disappointed i am after reading this book .
it 's not just that someone 's forgotten and unloved teddy comes to life and then is mistaken for a terrorist .
while the topic of this book may be a teaser to get our attention , reading the actual book is boring .
although i finished the book and found the end to be a bit better , i nearly point the book down have way through as a waste of reading time .
it was annoying , uncreative , and so ridiculously obvious that i had the whole novel figured out only a few chapters in .
this is why people believe they 've been ripped off ... and i ca n't blame them .
at times it had a pretty dry plot .
this was not one of those .
which ?
as some others have noted , the story is disjointed and does n't make sense .
okay i just finished this book and let me tell you , boring ! ! !
it throws you off completely and interrupts the flow .
this is recycled and tired diatribe from a man who seems to have a disturbingly high opinion of himself .
i kept reading hoping that it would get better .
( which by the way , was anything but a thriller .
instead , it 's bad chick lit with a side of even worse historical fiction .
it just did n't seem honest somehow and i do n't even know if that makes sense .
it was hard for me to willingly suspend my disbelief . her research about seals was spot on .
i did n't like a single one of them .
an elementary version of this type of story .
the ending did not shock me , because i just did not care by that point .
i found this novel rather boring and lacking the constant atmosphere of dread that each good horror story should have .
no problem .
but the book was only partially successful in this to me .
it was too quickly resolved .
i was largely indifferent to the characters because the author did not allow us to get to know any of them .
" sadly , that 's not a parody .
it is , however , a low - brow experience with many undeveloped , unreasonable characters and a senseless plot .
unfortunately although this is a well written book it has little going for it .
it 's tedious .
i get that sometimes there have to be sacrifices for the " greater good " but it was so unnecessary .
this is just so badly written it was impossible to read .
there were too many characters to follow and too many details about them .
unfortunately , this is not one of those books .
but even if i did not , i still would have found this book lacking in several areas .
in my personal opinion , there is no real character growth for any of these unfortunate characters .
my daughter does n't seem to understand why all of a sudden we are trying to potty train her because things seem to be just fine to her !
i mean a big let down .
i end up so mad at the book and the author for wasting my time that i need to vent .
this story was lacking in so many areas .
because the stories are so cookie cutter formulaic .
was very relieved when i read other people had the same experience and i was n't the only one completely disenchanted with this book .
" this feels like it was written with the intent to go straight to a really bad computer game .
it seemed the writer was grabbing at straws to complete this series and in my book it failed .
i will not read this book or author again .
i do n't understand why there has to be so much porn in these books .
but the biggest impact is probably felt by those that read it while not in the middle of change .
her character appears to be a structural device to ensure that the narrator , for a time at least , can experience happiness . can it last ?
i did n't find this book terribly good .
the idea has momentous promise .
" well , in some sense , yes , but not in the way we 'd thought ... "
it just plain stinks , with a few moments that keep things moving .
though i love the idea and story of this book , i did n't particularly like the way the story was told .
unfortunately , i gave into the hype and ended up reading this garbage .
i 'm not a fan of vampires and making this novel into a historical story did not work for me .
after reading all the reviews i was hoping it would captivate me .
very bad business .
if you respect yourself do not waste your time or money on this lousy good for nothing book !
her dialogue is stilted and her plot is unbelievable .
the symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times .
maybe not , but it will also rob one of all direction and purpose .
that should have been this turkey 's title !
much of the writing is disjointed and i was not able to finish the book .
i did n't find the book have any spirituality value at all .
the book is utterly confusing and annoying .
the plot is just silly and the dialogue is amateurish .
the premise is shaky .
but surely there could be a connection ?
the idea is so good , if only the author could have made it interesting .
there is the human clone element , but otherwise it 's not what i 'd call science fiction .
other than that it was just a rant .
( physical and spiritual ) but there were a number of things in the explanatory notes that i found erroneous .
( if you do n't want to know what characters have returned , skip this paragraph ) .
not a " great " book , just passable , with moments of brilliance , in my humble opinion .
promise of pleasure was more like promise of disappointment , desperation , boredom .
her writing seemed similar .
you end up skipping over those scenes since they become boring pretty quick .
i probably can not add to the reviews already given .
why do homosexual men disdain bisexual men ?
i 'm not really looking for steamy scenes ( do n't give me that look !
however , the writing style was only so - so and the characters seemed a bit flat .
i will not be purchasing that one .
the writing was poor and childish .
i was engaged in the first part of the book , especially with her confusing feelings for her boss .
i would have been very upset if i had spent money on this book .
it 's not -- in fact , it 's a very poor effort . the problem with the book is not the ending .
so , i turned off the heat ... let the steam slow , opened the lid and dumped in a cup of water .
this book was not only painfully derivative in its content , but the characters were given little to no dimension .
perhaps due to using my own imagination to cook , old family favorites , i found this book pretty basic , and uninteresting .
for instance , in their chapter on direct investment in gold , they make it sound like holding physical gold basically has no advantages to investing in digital gold .
there was just so much that it could have been , and the family just assumed it was a demon .
no character development there whatsoever .
disgusting to find out the so called power brokers and patriots are just a bunch of silly , shallow , greedy people which we suspected from watching them .
it was a little strange .
i have no idea who is supposed to be the protagonist or antagonist , but i didn&#8217;t care in the least for any of them .
there were some good parts , too , but at times the storyline was hard to follow and i got loss .
it did the job but i did n't enjoy it .
she s no virgin so this not projecting morality at all .
so my advise is to skip this one .
the characters were bland and so much description was about things that were n't relevant to the story .
the idea 's interesting , but there 's really no punch to the plot .
they might be better called " reminders . "
the book is chock full of various scenarios , many of which are are illustrated in silly , totally outdated cartoons .
it seemed a little far fetched to me .
i will wait until i can get a used copy or get it from the library , to minimize publisher profits .
this story though just did not satisfy .
if every character had been presented this way , it probably would have worked better , but to limit it to just one made that particular character seem a bit strange .
he fails to make a strong case .
( someone must have , or i could n't have run across one in a used book sale . )
i could have done housework instead .
i do n't know how it got the reviews it did .
i almost quit reading several times but i stuck it out for lack of anything else at hand to read .
if it were about baseball it 'd be equal to a dull statistical book rather than an interesting narrative about the sport itself .
if so , who ?
pastors get rich and can build big churches spewing this rubbish to unsuspecting , bible - illiterate seekers .
never did finish this book .
i could n't finish because the violence and language were awful .
she has no clue as to legal ethics ? ? ?
to me she was dumb , stupid and misguided .
i am sorry to say that this book was just incredibly hard to read .
she 's little better than an animal .
it just makes for a frustrating read .
in fact , this mini plot makes no sense and does n't even add anything to the overall story .
i was both bored , and irritated with it .
save yourself and look elsewhere .
it 's really hard for me to sympathize with someone who has done wrong when someone else turns around and does the same thing .
save your money and save your time .
still , i stand in awe of it , because it is just plain awful .
not much to do with the couple .
even more pitiful is the fact that people fall for this garbage .
the beginning was dumb , the ending stupid and in between was so very bad .
it just lacks a little ingenuity .
i read it through , just to see what happened , but i really should have just quit early on .
i thought " i 'm not really liking this book . "
unfortunately , after that it becomes simply an attempt to scare the reader with dire predictions .
there are many other fine books in the same vein that are interesting , engaging and informative ; this was a dull slog .
i do n't think i 've ever given a book one star but i truly did not like this book .
unfortunately , not a good read at all .
the mildly entertaining aspect of the book is the characterization of the heroine .
there are holes in the plot big enough to drive a truck to .
and just how did her lack of virginity get past the midwives that examined her for fertility ?
none whatsoever .
the flashbacks detracted from what little was there and the timing for the whole book was off .
i loved the idea of forbidden love between a witch and a vampire , but i just did n't get much out of this one .
since brief descriptions of this book have already been done by other reviewers , i wo n't even include it here . but i will give my opinion on this book .
i do n't actually know exactly what happened because i was n't that interested and kept finding myself drifting off rather than paying attention .
i found this book too degrading towards females .
i did n't eat lunch alone on a toilet seat or anything .
but this in itself is n't a scientific control .
i mean who would make that statement ?
kind of a sad but boring murder story .
the biggest disappointment is the photographs .
this book does n't contain anything new , but is poorly - written , choppy , and i found myself looking for missing pages more than once .
here his dialogue reaches new lows and the storyline is even too ridiculous for him .
this book did not work for me .
that being said , this novel left me wondering why i invested the time .
there are just way too much magic in the explanations .
in fact , only juvenile religious fanatics could .
not only that he is n't looking out for you .
halfway through the book , i thought who cares what happens to these people ; i just wanted to be done with it .
this book spent volumes on statistics , and the stories of the children who kill were , in some cases , less detailed then the newspaper articles would have been .
i was pretty excited to begin reading this novel , but once i had made it past the middle it just seemed to get more predictable and less interesting with time .
you will throw it away . also there is some subtle yet annoying political bias in the book very annoying , but his story can tell like wants .
it 's actually a little worse than " meh .
so i went into this book expecting , maybe not to love it , but to enjoy it .
you know the feeling when something is so bad or disappointing you want to run screaming from the room ?
it left me with an uncomfortable feeling , my spirit had been wounded .
it seemed as though the author gave almost no thought to setting .
that said , i believe the book was not as simplified as it could be for the beginner user .
and the fighting was n't even that good . it was kinda boring to be honest .
the bone doll 's twin is tame by comparison .
although the photographs are exquisite , i was quite disappointed in this book .
however , the plot is also highly padded and overly episodic .
this is not a novel , but unfortunately , it is n't good writing , either .
it was a good read but i was left disappointed by the focus on games and graphics .
the reading is really not worth it for another " chapter " .
also , the reviews were positive .
this is the biggest piece of trash that i have ever read .
quite frankly , i found it really hard to get into .
it was such an utter let down .
the writer did a poor job of defining evil - and her book focuses on it too much .
why would a mother spend her life working on a career if she could afford to spend her time with her own children ? ... ?
there is no rhyme or reason why and i 'm not liking where the story is going .
they rehash plots and dialog and lack originality .
this is the complete opposite . if the author wants to use this book as proof , then i can not agree with him .
i felt like i was in heck .
i 'm still not sure if i am disliking this book because it is dark but without other rewards ( e.g.
i 'm an author , therefore , i 'd love to say something positive about last orders , but i ca n't think of a thing .
it seems difficult to make a bad novel on one of the most intriguing figures in history , but nevertheless , this is a bad novel .
it just does n't make sense that he can leave a trail of maimed people and destroyed property without drawing the attention of hospitals or the law .
it 's really hard to be " into " a book when you do n't know who the hell is speaking .
the premise is that you should exercise which is hardly a revelation to anyone .
beyond that , the tone the authors is snobbish and condescending .
i have no idea where to start with describing just how bad this book really is .
track your spending .
and i do n't often try a recipe unless there is a photo to go with it .
the author did n't do her research .
what kind of mystery novel does n't have the characters solve the mystery ?
after the initial premise was developed , it was all downhill .
i got bored and did n't finish .
it sounds like the worse is yet to come ... so its back to the library with this book .
with this in mind , i really tried to like this book but it was just too strange and boring .
while the idea of the story had potential , it was poorly executed .
i felt no connection to the characters , no emotion towards them .
he 's a shill , plain and simple . don't waste your money .
i was also pretty disappointed that the book is supposed to be about this city full of people with super powers but you rarely see them .
which , i know this is fiction , but would n't you be worried about sexually transmitted diseases ?
and it is completely anti - climactic .
perhaps , it is because better stuff has been published since that time .
it is full of inaccuracies and provides no sources for the outrageous claims it makes .
this story was predictable and the characters lacked development .
poorly written , shallow plot , unrealistic characters .
there is only so far you can make someone inept and he did n't really seem to have any redeeming qualities .
i hope it is not as sophomoric as since there were no pictures i felt disconnected but maybe it is .
a completely worthless volume .
there is only so much money - borrowing , drinking and reliance on others for employment i can stand !
perhaps i missed something but the characters , settings and story telling just were not as rich nor developed ; humor was drab and predictable .
it was rather like being in a maze with no map .
it was either too slow , too scientific , too religious , too convoluted , too huh ? , or too boring .
i would borrow this book for a quick read , but i do n't recommend purchasing it .
if he is really sincere , why does n't he pay this back ? ? ? ? ?
i skimmed quite a few parts and that&#8217;s not a good thing when you want to read for an entertaining escape .
the characters too simple minded and childish .
none did .
except for the part where it was missing a page , a page of the story , not some extra , non - important page , it was .
i realize that writing and publishing are a business but am disappointed that an author whom i have enjoyed and respected would stoop to such a cheap trick .
i did nt like this at all .
with this one , there were too many places that rambled .
( i do n't want to give anything away ) it started off great and it ended rather badly .
i can not for the life of me understand how this thing ever found a publisher .
i hate when this happens because i find myself editing the book as i 'm reading , and i end up paying attention to every little mistake .
he said on camera he 'd produce it .
i have enjoyed all this series books but am very tired of the excessive coffee addiction statements .
was nt for me , glad it was free because i would have been upset had i paid for this !
how utterly sad ... this was not romantic to me .
did n't really deliver what the title promised .
i could n't help but feel there would have been a much more elegant and less wordy way of getting this point across .
i still ca n't believe i hung in and finished this awful story .
for starters , living in bayou country myself the characters and settings are completely unbelievable and off mark .
what a selfish heroine and dull romantic leads .
somehow , it just is n't the same .
i likely could have ended up liking this story if it had n't employed one of my most hated themes .
maybe i 'm not in the mood for this .
it was like some one gave him a formula to follow .
this book is useless from any perspective except perhaps as a doorstop .
seriously , do n't waste your time on this book .
as stated before it has no significance to the main story . most infuriating is the fact that the epilogue suggests a far more interesting story is about to occur .
if a linguistic sign is spoken or written , does it then become a word ?
did she think we 'd be too stupid to notice ? "
oops , wrong story .
or both . if you absolutely have to have this book , i suggest waiting for the soft cover version to come out .
this one left me dissatisfied .
i wo n't say how it ends , but it was a let down .
it seemed like it was written by a young person for a young crowd , however , this is not for a young adult .
i could not get involved with the book because i felt so detached from the setting that it takes place in .
and fails to hold my interest .
the reader is left to hope that the author 's opinions represent those of an informed expert , though we are given no reason to assume that is the case .
publisher , are you irresponsible ?
found this at the local library and the plot looked compelling .
i ca n't understand why this book is getting all the raves it is .
and for that trouble starts
her writing is n't good journalism , satire , or commentary , it is just plain deluded .
nothing spoils an author more than fame .
the story picks up tension particularly as it simply slides toward the climax . unfortunately , there are several obvious faults .
it 's very repetitious and predictable .
this series is just boring .
i did n't care for it and i love paranormal romance .
" and that basically sums up a lot of little issues with the writing in general .
there is also nothing wrong with benefiting others .
did n't finish reading the book due to boredom .
that book was ok .
i just found it flat -- couldn't get into the characters or the story .
it is also precious , mannered , false , cliched , and tedious .
complete trash .
the characters lack any depth and the dialog is painful at best .
i believe this should have been in the young persons book list .
not much of a suspense .
as for me i am grown and know not to listen to this garbage . avoid this book , you will be glad you did .
the book is a little misleading .
it was like they did n't know exactly how to tell her story so we got a side trip with a group of boring knights .
oh how boring but once i start a book i like to finish it , and boy did i struggle .
and not scary .
i saw that some other reviewer did not like his images but i disagree .
after skipping to the end , i found the plot had been predictable and silly .
i usually finish the books i get but it was n't one i wanted to .
i hope this was an old , recycled book because the author is usually a better writer than this .
i was n't dying to finish the book .
the author does a lot of " telling " instead of " showing , " and so the prose is just plain boring .
that is all you really need to know . as unbelievable as the characters are , the dialog is even worse .
it was like reading a diary instead of a novel .
there was not enough information on any one topic to be of any real use .
the latest ones in the series were just pathetic .
it just slows everything down .
this verbiage does nothing to create a deeper understanding of character or great ambiance .
i felt lied to by the book and that does n't happen too often .
well not really .
if not , then purchasing any of her books might prove a waste of precious money .
this is the most amateurish book i have ever had the misfortune to purchase .
while it sounds obvious , children 's nonfiction books should be fact - checked , and this one obviously was n't .
save your time , and pass on this one .
avoid it and look for one that actually seeks to tell the truth , not one that just pretends to .
i barely managed to force myself to finish this book .
i also felt that the plot was extremely weak - especially faith 's story , which was contrived & formulaic .
a boring recitation of historical events ?
but , each of these plot threads is teased out in an excruciating manner .
for example : * gabriel does n't sit at god 's left hand .
aa is the only " cult " i know of that requires adherence to no creed .
if i had read the whole book for that ending i would have been ticked off .
this makes his character far less interesting and sympathetic . there also seems to be a lot of padding in the book , probably in order to bulk it up .
do n't bother buying it new - if you are interested , buy it used or see if you can read it somewhere for free .
beware .
the characters were shallow , the plot thin and the end came out of nowhere .
it feels like there are large gaps in the story and the story itself seems to lack cohesiveness .
it is insulting to write up these religions in a ignorant and wildly inaccurate way .
i could have cared less why , where , how , whom . the ending was so weak = girlfriend and daughter .
this book was a complete letdown .
that being said , this book was far fetched and quite silly .
however , i did n't like that she had secrets but i understood why .
a big disappointment .
i had some difficulty with the authors / editors inability to capitalize the word " god , " and more than a little trouble with her police procedure .
i kept reading hoping that it would turn around , but to no avail .
her behavior is not only reckless , but she 's just asking to get killed .
overall i found the story unsatisfying and not nearly as informative about the history as i like in a historical novel .
i believe this is a false statement .
had the author a decent editor , or even an editor , maybe the glaring inconsistencies that overwhelm the book might have been avoided .
there 's nothing new , no novel analysis , nothing .
unless you count the truly horrendously bad come - backs she made .
however , while the author feels the need to explain what an " im " is , she glosses over rather intricate details that are related to the medical field .
or better yet , do n't buy this like i foolishly did , check this out of the library , throw it against the wall , and return it .
i was extremely dissapointed with this books .
" does god believe in atheists ? "
i , repeat , even trying to disguise it a lot , the intention of this book is to say : " come on , get over it " .
otherwise , this could be skipped .
whatever would this 20-year - old character know about it ?
i really do n't care how it turns out .
the description sounded promising , but i was in the end disappointed by this book .
the characters are dull , stultifying , snobby , mundane .
maybe a nurse could possibly let someone who admitted that she did n't know a patient let slip that the patient was in the hospital ... though not likely .
there is little action until the very end in this totally far fetched book .
i 'm a voracious reader and that 's really saying something .
but , i 'm afraid , this book is n't it . most of their arguments are strangely disconnected from their conclusions .
just unpolished with an unrealistic , meandering story .
the dialogue was contrived and so full of cliches , it about made my stomach turn .
i thought that much of the suggestions were somewhat superficial and even a little fake .
too much bondage sex .
the sex became repetative and boring .
this was a terrible last book in this series .
okay , this is the first avengers graphic novel that i 've ever read , and i found it to be somewhat dissapointing .
i believe some of the calorie counts are very low for what is really there and the recipes seem to be confusing at times on the way the ingredients are added .
this story has more potential than realized in this book .
this book is written for a ghetto audience with fantasies of a " protector .
can a baby tell if it 's a thief ?
the problem is , the conflict does n't build toward anything .
my advice : save your money on this one .
i mean let 's face it .
tried a few others , not for me .
there 's no word to describe how disappointing i am .
of course nobody would doubt that examples of conservative media bias exist .
using the " f " word in what seemed like every other sentence of dialogue was overkill .
let 's not even discuss the countless laws our heroine violated in her attempt to escape her abusive husband .
felt like it did n't even have a plot other than sex which was n't even exciting .
i just had such hopes for this book and it took so long to work my way thru it .
rarely have i been so annoyed while reading a book that had potential .
the language is way too basic with blatant mistakes in grammer and yet , i found myself pushing onward , hoping for some redeeming value never to be found .
she 's always been impulsive but not to this insane extent , putting everything on the line to stick by a man she suspects may be a murderer .
it says not to buy a clear ball but various colors .
i was so detached from the characters that i barely managed to finish it .
i 'd have been better off if i had .
he was described as an anti - hero .
much of the rest of the book was not very believeable .
i could n't get past these things and enjoy the book.1 .
unfortunately , there is n't much of a market for those books because i ca n't find them online .
listened to them and lost money .
if only to pass the time .
i went on the glowing reviews here .
the disappointment and the shock were too much for me .
i have yet to finish the book , but i would venture to guess that a fairly large chunk of the novel is fashioned from these fractured sentences .
i enjoyed this writer 's previous novels and expected to like this one too , but i was disappointed .
after contacting seller it was determined that the book was not available and charges were presumably refunded .
is this the sort of vapid ' society ' we want which ignores the human nature ?
i enjoy history , but i do not seem to be able to get through this boring book .
it 's just not for me .
i was hoping for alot more .
the sexual dynamics have moved on to a place that is kind of creepy and exploitive .
on that slim straw , the author tries to weave a rationale for involvement in the case .
while the protagonist is engaging the other characters are not very interesting .
but i would advice others to spend their money elsewhere .
i should have stuck to my guns , but when you 're in an airport and need something to read right now ...... i mean , how bad could it be ?
but are these parents really that bad ?
i did not enjoy this book in any way .
but it had no barring on the story what so ever . the story line here was boring also , a rich woman and her not so nerdy assistant / bodyguard .
perhaps a die - hard football fan would like it , as there are unending accounts of football plays .
no , this is not very good , in fact after attempting to reread it i found the prose amateurish and uninvolving .
but the dialogue in this book are beyond rediculous .
" i wanted to like this novel very much but it never happened .
the relationship felt forced and false , the adding of danger , was at best confusing at worst silly .
but the characters were stupid , the plot was virtually absent , the storyline completely implausible and the writing was atrocious . i could barely read this book to the end .
i found this book boring and not my cup of tea at all .
he claims this was not anti - semitism , either .
i found myself skipping large parts of the parties and details about dresses and such .
in fact , so much so that i did n't finish it , which is not like me .
hmmm , but destroyed how ?
i tried to remain open minded and hoped to get past the rantings , alas , they continued .
he has written a lengthy gossip piece without offering anything factual .
there was no story just a lot of self glorification .
which for a " space opera " is pretty bad .
it 's not glossy at all , which means most black areas look flat and drab .
there was absolutely no sexual tension ; it was all in their head , which never seems to materialize in their actions until the consummation scene .
rather than having actual depth to the characters , the ending makes everything completely meaningless .
i was definitely not impressed with this book .
this was too frustrating and unbelievable for my taste .
instead of being coy , he should have just used the character 's name .
overrated and overhyped .
there were some other parts of this book that so bordered on stupid that if i were to mention them , i would be giving away " who done it . "
action there is plenty but the setting is lacking .
they never hold a conversation , and this lack of payoff left me disappointed .
was thin - it was n't a mystery because there was nothing solve .
i lost interest , left the train in the middle of the first stop and found something to read that held my interest .
but the main body of the book is not at all like an introductory work .
the sheer redundancy of those thoughts , and most of them pretty dreary , is depressing .
pretty pretty please .
and that in itself is anachronistic - no aristocrat and definitely no lady would go on her hands and knees to dig up ancient ruins that might not even be there .
insta - book . maybe my suspicions are incorrect .
this just did n't have it .
let me guess ..... new series coming up ?
i would not recommend this to any literate or thinking person .
but that word punishment is n't even in there , he just makes you think it is unless you look it up .
but was n't for me .
as it is , he is simply a jarring distraction . the letters quoted by the author are an oddity in themselves .
but , their relationship was sort of weird .
this is the worst conversion to an ebook i 've seen yet .
there was so , so much potential in it , but i felt it was n't developed quite enough .
poorly done .
alot of the recipes have the same ingredients and just do nt really appeal to me .
but alas , there was none and once finished i was pissed i even spent money on this trash .
i did not receive this book either ... i need to pay more attention to what i order and if i am getting the products .... money out the window
as much as i have enjoyed the author 's earlier books i am disappointed with his latest .
it has no precious moments , no new insight , no flashes of inspiration .
for example , he writes that before the nt canon was compiled , the believers were engaged in liturgy or worship practices .
i 'd rather see off color terms in print than this drivel that makes the main character seem like a fool .
the book is painfully dull with unbelievable dialogue , especially between the protagonist and the girls .
but he ca n't kill her because that would end whatever it is they have .
- because ?
her voice was not what i expected .
the plot was not bad , it just was n't as fast moving as i was used to .
as for the bad guys , there 's no subtlety involved .
it was supposed to be a comical look at political issues but i could not wait to finish the book .
this book is painfully slow , the characters seemed wooden and not compelling .
and to my disappointment , it lead nowhere .
do not buy this in hardcover .
the author claims to be an expert in training and does not understand what a basic training term such as negative reinforcement means .
the children 's book author seemed to have little writing talent .
i am in the middle of the book and am disappointed .
i 've liked the last few storylines , and clone saga was definately a highlight , but this arc is one of the worst .
unfortunately for me , i could not keep up with the program in this book for practical reasons .
i loved the premise , thinking that it was something truly original , but it was not .
but the story in this was a bit weak to me .
this book is one i forced myself to drudge through in the hopes that its would get better ; it does n't , and in many ways it only got worse .
what happened to unrelentingly horrible olive ? ) .
did he discuss the discrepancies ?
i guess i missed that part .
it is that , but it is ruined by awful writing .
ok , what can i say that has n't been said ... allegiant is so boring , i could n't even finish it and skipped to the end .
i bought and read all the trilogy books but i found them all lacking .
the author probably had a good idea but needed a better editor .
at times it seems like material that could be more simply communicated is complicated by disorganization and uncommon terminology .
i was so excited for the conclusion of this series and i was sadly disappointed by the end of this book .
i 'm a liberal person and do nt mind sex scenes but not with children .
however i am stopping .
dialogue has to sound like people talk , fast , reactionary , imperfect .
i 'll order the tree version and have them fly it to me and drive it to my front door instead .
a writer who has reached late middle age should not still be spending pages and pages probing her ancient wounds .
i really am not interested in reading comic books at my age .
it 's just not up to his usual standards .
you do n't need to force your dog to do anything .
anyways , history does n't have to be boring , but this book is boring .
the obvious fallacy here is that the government worked hard to conceal the film because it proves a conspiracy .
he lies , inserts glaring inaccuracies , distorts time , people and places . i suppose it 's great fun if you 're looking for fiction , but history ?
i was so disappointed by some of her last books i decided not buy anymore , but i then decided to give her another chance .
that cold .
maybe it was the buildup i made from all the hype but i was n't too impressed .
check ?
i 'm sorry i even bothered .
the guy is a jerk i do n't think she should get back with him . this was a very disappointing and upsetting waste of my time .
after reading many of his tomes and enjoying most of them , it seemed his quality of story - telling dropped off .
it 's ok to let others help you .
later in the book , she admits to not believing in heaven at all .
there is nothing interesting about them to engage the reader .
sure , this was more believable , but it was also generic .
not much character development and battles are dull .
it could have been a good story , but it was just to dull and weak .
maybe they think the hardcore fans would not notice .
unfortunately , i can not say the same about this book .
did she forget it ?
now his writing seems somewhat juvenile and forced .
i could n't tell the voices apart .
alas , there is nothing new under the sun .
i doubt i 'll buy anymore of the series until i read reviews here .
it 's so boring .
there is not enough dialogue to move this story along .
never have , and after another reread just to make sure i was n't completely mad .... never will .
other times what he says is simply unnecessary .
it offers nothing , and it 's not enjoyable to read .
" so , where is this information they promised ?
in all , it made for a sloppy - feeling read that i had to compel myself to finish rather than the reverse .
frankly , what was she thinking ?
i felt like this book had no ending .
he or she would jump in with explanations which slow the story down and do n't make sense .
no need to spend time or money !
overall , i would not recommend this book to others .
yes ... boring ? ? ?
it appears to be associated with the fact that the government has taken over more and more of the risks that used to be borne privately .
it seems to me that we should use small - group gatherings , but not exclusively .
the characters were not relatable and the love scenes were kind of odd to me , as well .
in a book that is supposed to be about aliens and aging .
the story went to high schoolish , the writting was choppy and made it very hard to follow .
character repeatedly acts like an idiot for no reason except to keep the story going .
( however , they would have come up at some point , and i would have been searching to answer them .
not worth the money .
and then the ending is so rushed .
absolutely the most disgusting book i have ever read .
a prime example of what happens when an author becomes self - indulgent .
i can not understand how this book received such glowing reviews .
not nearly enough detail to be beneficial and a constant reiteration of the same text over and over from chapter to chapter .
if you 're looking for excitement and engagement , you might want to pass .
this book , however , barely seems as if he was involved in it .
a sign of the times , maybe , where people seem to want to write about other families with problems .
i had hoped for more ' lifestyle ' improvement ideas .
it just dragged , which i found very annoying .
not even good porno well written .
this book did not live up to the wait .
i found it disturbing to be based on a made up character .
slow down and write something interesting .
enough dithering already .
the plot is predictable , the characters not very deep , and the promised underwater menace and surprise never really materializes .
" granted , once a child has been mentally castrated , she should never be sexually approached later .
the stories are rather good .
a child certainly could not read it alone .
it started out good but then lapsed into these long descriptions of places and events that did n't interest me .
they are repetitious and as dull as a box of hammers .
but the author jumps around so much telling stories within stories and side stories i could n't keep track and found myself lost , confused , frustrated and annoyed .
dreadful !
this book needs some editing .
not to mention left me wondering how much of it was true and how much was made up .
the story is very interesting but i felt i was reading the same page over and over .
this is a very amateurish endeavor .
totally disgusted .
if they had , they would realize what a piece of garbage this is .
i believe that it is a very personal thing that should be done in private . all in all , i would not recommend this book .
if they were a part of the storyline , i am sorry that i did not get it .
too much darkness ; too little character .
however for some strange reason , i felt rushed while reading it .
this style may work well for some , but not so much for me .
semi - minor plot lines that seem to be leading into a bigger picture eventually go nowhere and are dropped without explanation .
the characters were n't poorly developed , but their development was openly displayed to the reader .
whoever edited this book should be fired - there are too many good authors out there trying to get their works in print .
some stories on the side are very uninteresting .
i thought the concept of the story was good but the book was very poorly written .
' oh , but you say , perhaps the writing got better and there were only a few spots that were rough .
in this case , i felt it more bloated the story to the point where i nearly stopped reading .
it was not worth my time .
she was spoilt , selfish , too self absorbed , a smoker .... need i go on ?
it 's too bad really , because his voyage and his achievements are extraordinary .
like most of these reviewers , i love the bdb but i just do n't understand what happened in this book ? ? ?
i have had this argument with many of the untrained before .
" everyone is entitled to their own opinion but not their own facts . "
call me naive , but not every man that is attracted to another woman other than his wife is going to act on that attraction .
i found myself trying to picture this and trying to figure out what in the heck she really meant by discipline .
to tell you the truth , i ordered this book by mistake .
the adjectives are elementary sometimes and idiotic other times .
the main character can stop whining anytime .
the story did n't hold me and the sub stories were boring .
the premise sounded great .
he did not enjoy this at all .
the subject is fascinating but the book is , unfortunately , edited in an amateurish way .
if you are looking for a real fantasy book , look elsewhere .
this book was n't worth .50 !
it does n't make any sense , especially when the family talked to each other like babies .
i 'm now beginning to skip paragraphs .
i had thought that perhaps i had missed the young adult designation for this book , but , no , this trite tale seems to be intended for the adult audience .
there are books i just ca n't get into and i push through anyway .
why cut it up ?
when i see something this incorrect it prejudices me against the entire book .
it was simply not a good book .
this one did n't really keep my attention , i think it was just too slow .
the characters were stereotypical , static and flat .
too much of it for me .
i was hoping for more basic diagrams .
the author has a biography saying she was a prolific romance writer , clearly they do n't need people who can really write english properly .
i would have no problem recommending this book to other readers .
but honestly , i bought the book hoping to gain insight into the songs , the artists , and the eras .
however , this series has been very difficult to read .
so i thought i had a few pages missing from my book , or something ; that 's how unfinished the story was / is to me .
the mystery is boring .
it gets pretty annoying .
there was a lot going on and the story lines are still incomplete .
it attempts to be at times , but the humour is so contrived it falls flat .
he did n't do any research !
the title alone should raise red flags .
a sorry effort .
total crook and a rip off and this guy and his group are crooks of the worst kind .
the " notes " section is poorly constructed , as there is no indication of what is extended in this section when you cover it in the main text .
what a waste of ink , paper and time .
i 'm not sure it 's correct to portray god 's redemptive work as being all about " romance " .
much of the book seems drawn out in an effort to up the word count .
i have to admit that i liked the writing style on this , at least a paragraph or page at a time .
but in the end , you are left dumbfounded .
what a waste of time on this lame book .
the plot was n't very interesting , the characters were n't either .
a great disappointment from an author whose works i 've enjoyed in the past .
i 've usually enjoyed books by this author , but do authors just eventually run out of good ideas ?
waste of time , money , and trees !
instead , this book is an introduction to an entire series of books about specific practices .
also missing was empathy for the victim because the author failed to humanize the character .
i was looking for something more suited for an adult .
the people in charge of solving this do indeed have too too many personal problems and not enough swapping of information .
none of the characters are likeable , the author is terrible at describing scenes , and her world building is weak .
and here lies why i 'm against the concept of the story .
maybe it is supposed to be more of a love conquerors all thing , but did not work for me .
i actually ended up skimming through those pages because i knew what was going to happen and did n't want to read the details .
i had such high hopes for this book and was drawn in immediately .
if you do n't like history do not bother reading the book .
there is a constant sense of melodrama to the writing that never finds fulfillment in the action .
they almost felt unintended , as if it was such a normal part of her that she did n't identify it as out of place in the novel .
it had all the elements i usually enjoy in a book , but the lack of connection left me feeling cold .
it was the general consensus that none of us would remain in grad school for long presenting such weak arguments .
in my opinion , this form of writing is laborious and boring . another huge problem is believability .
the more i read , the more i hated the book .
the author repeated this over and over .
i suppose i expected more .
he got these tapes also because he did nothing wrong .
it is nothing but page after page of unending misery .
i 'll just assume it is , if not i do n't care .
also what a shameless ploy to sell books .
not very useful to me .
it was the same words over and over .
the story starts off with a promising premise : a government experiment with vampires go awry , told from a multi - pov narrative .
they may not be saints but they are nothing like this mess .
not only was it presented incorrectly , this could never be presented t anyone as a gift .
i really tried to like this book in the face of all the glowing reviews .
after a while , the book became the same old , same old .
this book was so bad i ripped it up before i threw it away so no one else could read it and think all " romance " novels are this rotten .
he is such a fake !
they basically repeated over and over to be frugal , save money , teach your kids how to be frugal and save money , and that was it .
as a couple , the author does not always sell the lead 's romance ; they are distant and not truthful with each other .
but what i disliked the most was the fact that there were no likeable characters in this book .
it could almost be under historical fiction drama or something like that .
hello mr. attorney general ?
and do n't even get me started about the religious zealots . but the worst part was the ending .
if you are interested in a quality quick read , however , there are several other books i would happily recommend instead .
this book was so boring and had no life to it !
i ordered the sample and thought - okay not bad .
sorry , more better .
if you 're not you might be bored with predictable story line and characters that are n't developed to the point where you care what happens to them .
if you 're reading this review looking for something lighthearted and fast to take on a long vacation , there is much better .
hard to stay focused on the plot .
he was rude , crude , and just mean .
too much torture too much intense pain .
i never could really understand what its thesis was , or what the recitation of sketches of various biblical figures was supposed to demonstrate .
women were totally ignored ..... sorry but in real life women would have had a profound effect on a situation like this .
unfortunately , it did n't get any better .
she should have tried harder to free him sooner , instead of moaning about her lot in life .
i would skip this entry of the series .
unfortunately , this can not be said for the rest of the book .
ok , so what ?
but , folks : the president does n't have that much power .
i 'm not gon na get specific , but the purported intelligence and psychological profile of the villain - type character had potential for a really good emotional ending .
and he actually hopes she 'll refuse his ' gentlemanly ' but obviously meaningless protest .
was this suppose to be puberty ?
the plot showed no real depth or complexity and the dialog was shallow and uninteresting .
she was a mom who , though she had lost a child , lamented pregnancy because it would keep her from being her .
and it still is n't enough to drown all the whining and lip - biting .
no one in the book uses drugs casually or experiments a couple of times with few ill effects .
call me lazy , but when i read fiction , i do n't want to have to struggle to figure out whose point of view i 'm reading .
disappointing book , slow going to read .
there is no spark , no lift , no enthusiasm .
i feel as if i wasted money and i borrowed it from the library .
no one changes . plus , the whole thing about his scar at birth is ridiculous .
) but let 's forget about the " spy " part of " spy novel " for a while .
this was a book club book and the discussion was not positive .
i further agree with the author that there is ( at least for now ) no compelling evidence that people are genetically inclined towards addiction .
but i felt i was wading through something that felt akin to gossip about his circle of friends ' neurotic problems , which cope uses to illustrate concepts .
i can see where the program would work well for some , but for me it was simply too difficult to follow .
is dumbfounded by any scientific term more complicated than dna .
the story does n't start really moving until halfway through the book , almost to the exact page , and even then , it 's never a page - turner .
pretty much just poorly written pseudo - porn .
occurs over a long time period and the writing was tedious at moments .
he 's damaged too .
read this book . while the book does contain some factual information , too much of it is buried in a sea of vitriolic statements against the above - named ministers .
this author thought he was sooo cool because he was a meth cook and was so proud of himself , it made me sick .
i have to be honest , i did not like this story , maybe l am in the minority , but the author did not write a very good story .
the characters are very shallow , never given the chance to grow or to delve into them to see who they are .
a really awful secret .
the page - and - a - half was about care and maintenance for the instrument , which was helpful .
and no , the yeast was n't stale as they said when i commented i was having a problem with rise .
non - consensual sex scenes offend me .
time travel is my favorite romance subgenre and unfortunately there are a lot of duds out there .
the author rambles through the dialogue and uses very odd descriptions like this one " he could smell the vague odor of the long flight in her hair .
oh well , at least i did n't pay for this book .
story about the kidnapping of a president is really implausable .
i did n't really ever feel like she was a real person , so i could n't really connect with her personal dramas .
i found the hero to be full of self - pity and self - hatred -- i mean the book does start with him contemplating suicide .
besides being too long and cluttered with trivia this book lacks balance .
not up to past books .
however , the way the plot is executed is n't a smart one .
i lost interest and never finished it .
it is obviously an ancient male conspiracy usually in the name of religion causing the women of the world to be virtual slaves .
no answers .
no seduction ?
nothing like that here . with a family of real estate agents at the center of a book , generational conflicts and sibling rivalries could spice up the plot .
to care about what happened to him , but nothing ever did .
this final book was pretty on par with how i expected it to end , disappointing , boring , and not much actually happening .
so for me , it was useless .
it does not get my recommendation .
sure hell is for real ; but this book ai n't .
as wrong as allowing an injured animal to suffer out of a human inability to let go .
do not recommend to anyone .
did n't do , i mean .
did n't care for the writing or was it the translations fault ?
i 'm sure there 's a story buried somewhere among the f - words ( and other profanity ) , but i wo n't be sticking around to find out .
there was so much potential in the plot and characters , but the author really missed the mark .
i wanted to see more character development , and dare i say it , less sex .
but do n't spend too much time .
there would be a reason for that .
perhaps because i felt misled - did not realize it was book written for very young readers unlike prior books .
the book jumps into the head of every single person who is named in the story .
none except the cute front cover .
just not a good story .
it is an abridged version ! maybe i made an error in choosing this edition , but do n't make the same , and buy the original version !
lots of scenes that play out like this : " oh , there 's a new bad guy !
if you are looking for the overall spectrum about event planning , then i would not suggest this book .
i found this book to be slow in parts and amusing in parts .
nothing said about this being a story continued later .
that s annoying and is going to make me not read anymore of her novels .
her son , so bland as to be nearly non - existent .
the bad cop is an obvious psychopath and nobody notices but the crazy trailer park lady .
the reader is supposed to believe the hero is a charismatic , intelligent man who is passionate about his career .
this book , for instance , has a winsome title but dull prose .
it is a ridiculous story .
rather , he commands it himself !
but it was poorly utilized .
i can barely keep the plot or the characters straight .
this kind of " advice " is stultifying .
" no !
there 's not much more that can be done with this character . i'm forcing myself to finish this book cuz i paid for it .
that takes up barely the last tenth of the novel , if that .
the story is not the worst i ever read but i prefer something with more " meat " to it .
women could break off an engagement .
do n't get me wrong , love is great , but i think that the melodrama cheapened the love , making it unrealistic and boring .
i can not imagine why .
nothing , absolutely nothing happens in this book . what a waste of paper .
when i took the class , i did not finish reading it and i hated it then .
i found much of the dialogue to be extremely unrealistic for sake of a simple chuckle .
it 's hollow , pompous , and utterly pointless .
not credible in the least .
he is by far the worst writer ever .
sex scene after sex scene .
i found myself skipping over pages .
the trouble with all this ?
it is n't even literature .
ok , that 's a viewpoint .
she claims to be in love with the were .
probably by falling through an elevator or something -- nobody cares about the details , not even the author .
i do n't recommend it . this premise as well as the character cameos create a promising and interesting starting place for the book .
but , this was awful .
which made it impossible for me to see her as anything else .
the author starts with a nice premise , but unfortunately there 's not much plot development happening .
the author seems to have a strong preference for mothers working outside the home , which i think is a bit outdated .
because it is not .
sadly , it did n't get there .
whatever happened to plot development ?
however , it was just boring .
too much sex and not enough substance in the storyline .
slow , plodding writing coupled with uninteresting characters and a dull plot made this book a chore to read .
of course it did n't improve the steaminess of the sex scene either .
however , this one seems to be annoying rather than enjoyable .
their behavior was born of lack of intelligence .
the tutorials and sample code require the reader to already be quite familiar with objective - c , and the author does not provide clear explanations .
the dialog was stilted and the plot was predictable .
uh huh , okay .
so buy her earlier books , skip this one .
i was even more confused by the plot summary there .
he basically becomes the " gay " best friend that many chicks fell in love with back in high school or college who would never reciprocate that feeling .
the concept is brilliant , the execution weak .
i did n't really care much for the story , it was kind of boring and did n't keep my attention for long .
the characters were run - of - the - mill fantasy characters that never seemed to grow or feel real .
he uses terrible grammar , repeats himself several times , and goes off on tangents that have nothing to do with the paragraphs around them .
i was duped into voting for the guy too .
the content pales in comparison .
it 's just a very stiff , mechanically written book ; kind of like reading someone 's diary .
there is plenty of life lessons and meaningful dialogue , but it failed to keep me engaged .
not my kind of book .
the ending was predictable , too drawn out , and a little dissapointing .
i could say more specifics about what i did n't like in this book but i will leave it as - not worth the money ! !
was the basic premise and i think he has some good practices to follow . i wish i could star the different sections .
no offense to the author .
it certainly is n't the author 's fault that the book is a poor fit for me in particular .
i should have read the reviews .
waste of time to read .
but i thought they might take on more maturity in this interpretation . sadly , they did n't .
it was n't a bad " read " per se .
the story line was fine but writing was painful to read .
seems that the only one supposed to know it 's location , is the author of the book .
there are no facts to back up her criticisms , and she just does n't seem to think much of social workers .
boring and trivial , mixed with copious quantities of irrationality , were the ingredients that i got out of the story .
it was hard for me to visualize the setting , too .
an awkward love interest ends in a convenient but not very believable way .
a bunch of really absurd stories that were supposedly written by a babysitter about her charges .
but there was just too much going on for me i think .
she ca n't have a legitimate opinion about anything because she ca n't remember who she is .
the author is not a psychologist , so the best he can do is report and summarize the research .
i did n't really care for this .
but does nt measure up to its influences .
yes , and that 's its biggest problem .
the book is at times choppy in motion and repetitive in content .
this was a book i could not get into .
i do n't see it in the table of contents .
this time , however , our writer 's imagination has completely failed her .
talk about a headache .
it just did not work for me .
" i read this paragraph .
the most annoying part is when they talk about their prior training , it makes an already unrealistic genre even more hard to believe .
before i go any further , i make no claims about the author 's actual intent .
just did n't impress me .
" prim , forget school that 'll get your nowhere .
i am left with nothing but regret for owning this book .
for me , it was too boring .
there are many books devoted to this subject , or free on the net . conclusion : there 's no " new rich " .
did not shoot himself .
the thing i hated the most was the repeated reference to the bad guys , fond memories of raping and killing .
i have no idea how this book would get so many glowing reviews ?
the novel is too long and slow - moving , and by the time you finally finish , you 're more or less indifferent to the fate of the protagonists .
the ending was the only part that held some interest , otherwise skip this drivel .
it was bloated to the point of being laughable .
this one should not have left the editors 's desk !
because already i just do n't care .
.... as it is , i could n't finish it .
the pictures earn the book a star .
i confess : i fell for this .
these were not very novel , creative , or healthy .
the same sex scenes over and over and over .... i do n't mean similar scenes , i mean verbatim .
could this book have been worse ?
i found this book boring and plodding .... and not well written .
the rest of us will giggle at the silly contrived plot devices and yawn at the predictability of it all .
i was not required to write a positive review , obviously .
i especially hated the ending . i have read some excellent books which concern rape and violence against women , but i was not reading them for pleasure .
this book would be better categorized as erotica rather than romance .
but for adults ?
not the heavy theology end , but rather the more literary end ) .
unfortunately , this latest sequel is repititious , repetitive , and says the same things over and over again .
the plot went off in different directions and left hanging .
i found it distasteful and inane .
he cancelled their date , saying he was going back earlier .
but then maybe we should rely on historians or political scientists for advice on this topic ( not to mention moral philosophers ! ) .
i really do n't need to be googling every few pages on what a word means .
the characters are bland , the plot overdrawn and protracted , and the ending no surprise .
it 's hard to get a sense of the audience this book was trying to reach .
it becomes frustrating to read .
the author , it seems , has an agenda .
" i do n't want juice anymore . "
but god is faithful in his promises .
this woman totally creeps me out .
wish i had instead of wasting my time and money
i could barely finish the book .
but i am disappointed with this book .
she basically wanders around .
the characters are stupid and wishy - washy .
sad terrible ending .
stupid and mechanical , so damn predictable and stupid .
i 'm not against religion but a little warning would have been nice .
however , this does not really resolve the debate .
i began skipping parts just so i could finish it .
crazy just did n't elicit the same emotions for me .
i think that was there was so much more potential to explore with the relationships in this book while still making her points about science and the environment .
seduced by hype ?
no character tension .
they did n't even like it !
not bad , but definitely for the scientifically inclined .
the main characters did nt even meet til halfway in which would be fine if the book found an interesting way to fill the pages which is did nt .
this book tries to be a ghost story and a romance , and it just does n't really go well together .
maybe he should stick to nonfiction .
also , there was a lack of action .
the ending though , is too far out for me .
it 's too bad the author had to throw that in at the end for no logical reason whatsoever .
it 's so repetitive and pointless .
a disappointing waste of time and money .
poorly written does n't begin to describe it .
it was not a very good lead in from last book to this one .
i did n't like it , and wo n't recommend it to anyone .
this little book was a novel ?
i stand by my review and will not be further bullied by someone who does not agree with my opinion .
if you have a teacher , then this may not be bad for you or your kids .
i found the story dull and the characters whiney .
the book ends with a lack of meaning or purpose and without resolution .
not to my mind .
the foreigners are generally selfish , dumb , or devious in some way .
not a fun read at all , struggled to finish it .
after reading the book i forgot and stopped caring .
the subject matter is interesting but the writing did not capture my interest -- it was boring .
the writer definitely has promise and perhaps she had no idea that the story was not entirely her own .
just a glaring inconsistency which bothered me . the movie is much more entertaining .
do n't look to others to say you 're okay .
the vampire aspect to the story was ok but had no real attraction for me .
the worst part of this novel - the typos !
i have found the characters very hard to keep track of .
if you 're a rank beginner perhaps it would help you a bit , but i 'm just sorry i bought it .
another reason given for the illegal abortion is a lack of sufficient funds to pay for the procedure .
very dry reading , and for some reason the author felt the need to use the subject 's full name in every sentence .
perhaps i just could n't get into the whole ghost thing .
this is an unremittingly dreadful book .
( warning : spoilers ahead .
simply get away from them ; do n't try to explain something for which there is no explanation .
there are better books out there , this is not worth the effort .
moment would have been when he realized he was nt a babe magnet . the sex chapter seems odd and out of place .
like he 's got nothing better to do than make gourmet meals in a hunting and gathering lifestyle .
sadly , the answer was ........ nowhere . i just could n't bring myself to finish this book .
tsk tsk tsk ..... lazy .
i did n't think i was ever going to plow through it .
this book is basically like the author 's other less expensive book .
the lack of expression in the husband .
? is he completely nuts ? ? ?
what if they decide not to disclose anything ?
as a piece of science fiction let alone literature it falls flat on numerous counts .
a friend chose this for our book club selection and although i really wanted to just abandon it , i did end up finishing it .
i simply do not believe , in anything .
i did not find this book at all engaging .
it almost felt forced .
if he does , he certainly did n't share it in the text .
but , the ending was just beyond belief .
even the internal ramblings are filled to the brim with cussing .
the main characters made me roll my eyes and finally i just stopped ... don't waste your time !
i just could n't keep up with what was going on , and i did n't feel i knew enough about the characters to care much about them .
i finally ended up just skimming the last few pages before i put it down for good .
he is the ultimate alpha male which is hot despite the rest of the book . however , i am still willing to give this author another try ...
another problem , especially with this book in particular , was the lack of editing .
the only flaw either character displayed was a serious codependent tendency to feel guilty about everything , even when it was n't their fault .
do n't you think that might be time better spent ?
i guess that is what i feel i 've just read , a lazy book .
ponderous run - on sentences drag you down , and suck out the fun .
while he was cute he was pretty darn dull .
she was very immature and whiny .
that 's fine , but it was just boring .
the characters were underdeveloped , and i did n't really care about them at all .
between that and the loose editing it was just too frustrating for me to wade through .
when a friend at work suggested this book , i gave it a try .
i hate not finishing books so i powered though and finished it .
a guy who immediately falls in love with the heroine and " winks " way too much , practically very time he looks at her .
do n't waste even that .
this book is not a tool kit .
just the amount of disrespect is enough to make you return this book instantly , not the mention all the errors in translation .
i could not warm to him and could not identify any sexual pull .
instead , i got some insight into how stores do their best to sell , whether we want to buy or not .
or try anything else , either .
i just could n't wrap my mind around it , it made no sense and it got really boring .
overall if your looking for a light contemporary this is it , but the characters are n't very original and it was very stereotypical to me .
save your money and just look at the cover . my recommendation : please do not buy this book .
what i 'm not okay with is his writing : it 's often disorganized , trite , fixated on sex , and more concerned with being shocking rather than logical .
i slogged halfway though it and then skipped to the last few pages .
( i got it from the library and had nothing else at all to read or would never have finished it . )
her scenes of rage were ugly and repetitive .
i wo n't belabor the point here -- suffice it to say that based on the reviews i was hoping for lots more .
but needs a lot of polish .
plotwise we have another disappointing hardcover clone wars novel .
and , of course , someone should ask clancy to get off his soapbox .
and the ending was ... confusing , to say the least .
no thanks .... i got enough of this guy . the transcript is also larded with the convoluted questions of participants who can not get to the point .
trying to figure out what i did to deserve this punishment .
where , oh where , was the editor here ?
it 's no wonder why her father beat her .
while there is a small section about the exercises , to be honest , i did n't see an exercise in there that was particularly original .
it 's not your field .
" was " instead of " were , " " say " instead of " says " and so forth .
omg , what a big waste of time ! !
beware this peculiar book .
he 's not really supportive of him , but admires his all the same .
perhaps a waiting room , maybe it 's jury selection , whatever .
it seemed excessively brutal , gratuitous violence used to cover up writing that has gotten formulaic and uninteresting .
the writing really annoyed me for some reason , and so did the audio book narrator 's voice .
he dislikes intensely the ' travel safari business ' but maybe dislikes foreign aid even more .
the fact that some of the 5-star reviews for this book claim that those of us who do not like it " do n't get " literature is just rude .
there are no good reasons given for why they need to live in the woods at all .
having read her newer books , i thought i 'd go back to some of her earlier work .... not much has changed .
too much crammed in , too little time spent with the characters that counted .
the weakest part of the book is source citations , which are very few .
" every once in a while something seemingly positive would happen , and i would think ... maybe ... maybe he 's going to have one good experience on this trip .
she is n't really pregnant .
some things , however , still seemed contrived .
do n't be a sucker like i was .
i rely on other reviews alot .
it contains no new ideas , no fresh analysis , and no deep insights whatsoever .
it sounds compelling , when i type it that way , but i had already been bored by the book .
and it was n't just his name .
the characters were shallow and often their actions did n't make sense .
" dancers moved across the floor in shapes like water , if water were considerably less graceful than it is . "
no student should hate themselves because they repeatedly try but fail .
dead end plot lines dropped in like stale cookies , characters with lame back stories , and an ending visible from early on , these problems and more plague this book .
i continued to read because i hoped for a decent plot , but again i was disappointed .
okay book , did n't require a lot of thinking .
at least i felt he was a well fleshed out ( no pun intended ) character .
then i said .
i was expecting inside stories , short , of the many places , teams , individuals , he had come in contact with , and written about .
that s a trend ?
the book itself is quite cute , but it 's just so small .
i might try to finish because i paid for it .
i do n't think that was ever mentioned .
thus , demonstrably he was not a critic of superstition , but its avatar .
the book suddenly ends , leaving too many open threads and with no satisfying conclusion .
i 'm sure other will like , just not me .
this book attempts to do the same but , in the end , it 's basically a sneering portrait of high society .
if you decide to read it , know that this is not a standard book .
it leads me to wonder if many of the reviews here are being written by the same person .
the twin sister is really poorly developed .
i am sorry your non - existant editor did n't help you or get you a ghost writer .
quite frankly , i found it boring !
this book is so sophomoric and poorly written .
everyone is supposed to be so powerful to the point of being " scary " , but are totally lame when it comes to any actual conflict .
truly , not worth the money or the time it took to read .
i had high hope for this , being a fan of the gossip girl series , but i was very disappointed upon reading it .
the title is apparently for another book , since it does nt apply to this one at all .
basically a fact - based crime caper .
there were so many places in this book that could have been so much shorter rather than drawn out .
there were points as i was reading the first third of the book ( and thinking more than once " why am i wasting time with this ? " )
i 'm not trying to be harsh just honest about how i felt about the book .
west is too wordy and too preachy for me . the condition of the book is fine .
continually left me with negative feelings throughout the book and at times did not want to finish the story .
this was n't the time or place for it .
the daughter was not as bad as others said and while it was rather cliche at times it was not over the top or jarring .
most of the political lecture is pretty boring and , what 's worse , much of it is hard to swallow .
it reads like she pulled previously deleted scenes from past books and used them to flesh out her thin plot .
there was no drama to the end and it seemed to leave me hanging , expecting more .
this book turned out to be a joke ... on me , i guess .
do n't waste your money as i did
a literary device full of potential , it became something of a dead horse in these books .
it did n't stay in my short term memory very long .
flooding an animal basically means forcing it to do a particular behavior .
no , it 's not meant to be funny .
why is a plot that constantly revolves around a woman who cheats on a man she supposedly loves considered acceptable .
it 's not worth anyone 's time .
no plot , not believable and poor poor writing .
you do n't just suddenly discover truly sick behavior - you have some warnings about it .
did n't see the women working on the same case .
characters are left hanging without resolution and women are depicted as nothing more than sperm holes .
as for action - the whole plot line was a yawn fest .
i really , really wanted to like this book , but i just could not .
suddenly , the heroine is believing her husband was murdered , with no work up to it and nothing for us to believe it , either .
the entire " plot " , if you can call it a plot , was printed on the back cover .
i do n't know why he wasted his talent writing such an ugly novel .
he did n't discuss the facts v. fiction items like he has in past books though .
his was dirty and creepy . the story line was too stupid to be believable .
i will continue to enjoy his sci - fi novels , but your hate mail was a waste of my time and money .
the writing is simple and fast , but i did not really care what happened .
each has been unreadable and this one is no exception .
there are numerous discrepancies that do n't jibe with the original , and i could get past that if the characters were authentic .
sorry ----
i just was n't interested , some of the decisions made by the characters were like " really , does that seem intelligent ? "
there is nothing good about this book , no nothing at all .
emotional descriptions are flat .
the family seemed to want to come together - but they were too busy being " politically correct " with one another .
the female characters are really badly written , even by his own standards .
although i did finish it , the writing was disjointed , the story meanders , and the characters not all that likable or believable .
this book has such a strong premise , so it is such a shame that it fell flat for me .
the hero is n't tragic and damaged , he 's controlling and abusive and childish .
this book was very hard to follow and at times i felt that something was missing .
it just left me very disappointed .
steer clear , unoriginal and frankly boring .
i even think the main character had some strong likeable qualities but they got lost in the violence .
i also dislike the " i speak for all women " type of tone adopted in the book .
just is n't believable for me .
i hate it when people do n't work out the implications of their own sloppy theorizing .
this book is not too complicated to understand , any more than a puzzle is beyond the abilities of the builder when there are pieces missing .
another disappointment .
such a book it is not .
generally unimpressive .
there has to be a heroine and a strong hero , and the other male characters weak .
it 's almost as if the plot is an afterthought .
because now you 're the crazy one if you keep refusing to believe . plus the firestorm thing left me feeling confused and letdown .
filler , filler , filler and so little real substance .
i know you are just supposed to go with it , but it has to at least look like an unavoidable situation , and this did not .
the writing in this book is so poor and so tedious it makes me marvel at how some people can be called authors .
to me , not clever but depressing with no redeeming qualities .
not a chance . finally , the computer game playing sections are totally unnecessary .
and i really mean predictable .
oh , and get a good editor , there were several obvious typos also .
it 's another form of dishonesty .
despite the title , and the fact that an actual journey does occur , this book goes nowhere .
this could have worked as a short story , the elements were there but the execution was too labored and i found myself drifting and skimming .
i guess i was too busy rolling my eyes !
but the sex scenes are hotter in dream land than real life . the writing is so amateurish .
i mean there 's no particular point , or insight , or meaning , or storytelling arc .
i managed to finish this book , but in retrospect , i would have done better to abandon it mid - read .
it becomes very repetitive and the author spends a lot of time pitching his other books and games and seminars , etc .
in saying that god formed man from the dust of the earth , he does not mean that god actually molded a man 's body out of clay .
waiting to discover my anticipation of disappointment is mere paranoia from books gone by , i read on .
it seems he has a secret research project going on and he might be allowed to get in on it .
this return to fiction , though , was really disappointing to me .
i did n't get very far until i was disappointed .
why were n't they talking instead of esther ..... oh , i forgot ... they were talking through her !
he is an arrogant and misogynistic creep .
( how about just controlling the meeting ?
it does n't provide much depth into the understanding of the brain , neither the actual examples in the it industry .
oh my gosh what a monumentally boring book .
this one started off okay in the beginning .
she started off as seemingly disturbed and over the course of the book turned into an entitled , obnoxious young woman .
it read like a very sorry attempt of the author trying to spice up their sex . i'm sorry to write a bad review .
that instant that you know from now on ... it 's all downhill .
unfortunately this latest book lacks the humor and depth in any of the characters .
still , i have to admit , the story is sort of compelling , in a shallow and pointless way that somehow perfectly describes the characters and their situations .
in addition , she repeats the same point over and over again .
the writing did get repetitive at the end and i mean that literally .
an almost puerile exercise , this one .
there is more anti - abortion agenda in this book than actual plot .
in fact a couple of the pictures i thought i could just walk into .
the writing style is awkward and stilted and it takes a real effort to push through to the end .
i do n't understand the purpose of something like this in a book that is supposed to be lighthearted and funny .
however , i can not recommend the book .
transparent attempts at pretending to be sympathetic towards nash were very common .
but we did n't need an entire book to hammer that fact home .
photo editing ?
if i want porn , i would buy books stating that they are porn !
this is just not my type of book .
" such overplayed and poorly thought - out drama !
or a gee - whiz editorial move ?
but why i found it to be even worse than expected is the extreme hypocrisy of the author .
the dishonesty demonstrated here could be damaging .
if you like the plot of this book , you should definitely read it , but if not , do n't bother .
some times it seemed like weird was the theme just for the sake of being " weird . "
i also made a big mistake not reading the reviews , had i done so i would never have read this book free or not .
i very seldom write a bad review , but in this case i could not resist .
if that is indeed the case , my appetite for this genre has already been sated . the main problem is that nothing much happens .
be it physical or spiritual , something happened and this book cheapens it .
the graphic novel might 've been better if a lot more direct references to the album had been made ( eg .
i thought the characters were all cliches and not believable .
actually , that 's not fair .
a weak and mindless main character with nothing but questions in her mind .
doing so many assignments on the same boring book got old .
if , however , god created the universe , the universe is evidence that god exists and " no god " is not an option .
except for the porn .
but , his characters seemed rather flat .
do n't waste your time and money on this one .
i had read so many glowing reviews that i kept thinking that the story has to get better , faster , more interesting somewhere along the line .
it 's like her saying they deserve equal rights , but to stay away from them because they are not to be trusted and are dangerous because they are too different .
the only connection they really had was lust .
if someone can help me better understand the author 's macro take on information , please write a review .
the artwork was weird , though .
not for me anyway .
i did not understand the stories , the endings , what she was trying to get across .
let 's not encourage them any more .
save your money and your time .
i honestly do n't know how the authors could have submitted this work .
the only way to describe this waste of a tree . don't waste your money .
any other book about the holocaust would be a better choice for your time and money .
it 's boring , dull and and does n't seem to go anywhere .
just like a bad movie this book was terrible .
this story is not new , and to be blunt i am fairly tired of new authors being repetitive , bring something intriguing , bold , unexpected to the table .
at least there is a villain this time around .
the fiance does n't really fight to keep her , not a great conflict . so honestly , it was pretty boring .
it 's quite short and i suppose mildly entertaining , but that 's about it .
his rationalizations are well - written , but now ring totally hollow .
unfortunately , i am reluctant to abandon a book , even one like this , that i have been negotiating laboriously .
they show absolutely no development , only more regression into the spoiled children they started as .
i usually always try to finish a book , but it 's just not going to happen .
it 's decently written but quite generic and when i read tips like " learn from your mistakes " , i ca n't help but roll my eyes .
why would she keep such a claim within her text ?
the plot is lifeless and predictable and the characters are shallow and under - developed .
i had such great hopes .
the story drags on for a long , long time until anything happens .
this book went nowhere fast , i quit reading it halfway thru the book .
this i just was n't interested in finishing .
full of his opinions which are backed up with little to no facts other than the ones that exist in the author 's mind .
i would recommend you do n't waste your money on this book .
i also found it very difficult to care what happened to the characters , since there was very little advancement in their development in this volume .
unfortunately , after this point , her dialogue might as well have come from a completely different character .
it is not bad instruction or anything like that .
however , i found this title too technical as i play by ear .
luckily , it 's not boring .
the author perpetuates the myth that size alone is an indicator of health , which it absolutely is not .
i thought the book lacked a tight focus and had few , if any real tangible insights into why people click .
it was a very boring read that will drag out in to a couple more boring books and i never made it the end .
i bought this book because it received high customer reviews .
there 's nothing more to be said .
i honestly do n't know if i can finish it .
no spell check was done on the new text to correct conversion errors .
except that it 's network conquests not sexual ones .
this book was a total waste of my money and time ...
that 's a big no for me .
not really worth buying .
kind of became repetitive , broken promises , attacks , etc .
the story had merit but was too unrealistic for me .
if so , it certainly did not happen .
the concept is great but the prose is just horrible .
) there is one disadvantage : i now am horribly disappointed in the other fertility / pregnancy related books .
something happened and they stopped seeing each other . however , most of the stories have an even worse thing in common .
but it 's ok , because the guy he kills is a thief .
this book was overly rated .
honestly there 's not much more to say , and the story quickly becomes boring .
i thought this would be a great devotional , however , i was disappointed .
as a result , the narrator sounds like either a yuppie trying to be one of the boys , or an ordinary guy trying to sound intellectual .
at that time , i could n't get through it - finding it pedantic , tedious , and obtuse .
the story would have been heartwarming if the main character had actually been funny , but instead he was pathetic . overall , the actor who read the book was terrible .
too many anecdotes .
this is a great idea but , in my humble opinion , very poorly executed .
the only ` sacred cow ' in the book is the big oil , and unfortunately it is excluded form meaningful critical analysis .
definitely a disappointing read .
this book was a very slow read and very boring .
i came away disappointed , however , in what i considered a rather pat , shallow story .
in my opinion , it seemed like it did n't really fit .
does it really not help them at all ?
just do n't be a moron , like i was , thinking that there was even a shred of truth to it .
she 's big on claims and short on any proof or documentation .
lots of discussion about how awful students ' writing was .
" man ca n't save himself .
the recurring formula is : tell readers it 's not their fault .
the good writing does n't makeup for the idiot detective work .
i did n't enjoy the narrator either , his tone just sounded bitter .
apparently they are .
i wanted to learn more .
and i was expecting something salacious ; what a disappointment . it occurred to me to wonder whether this book was actually intended as a satire .
i do n't recall reading any books by this author , so i ca n't compare to the others .
i do n't really see a potential target audience here .
i read a part of it and then stopped reading it .
some interesting historical accounts ( investigation of a mine disaster ) did not make up for a weak theme .
this book is not the book i received in the mail .
i would not have finished it had i not felt compelled to do so to write a review .
but without that context , this book feels anemic .
or was there foul play ?
or are you going to die too ? ?
this is one for the rubbish bin .
sex is a card he plays when he wants to . overall , unimpressive , not worth the money .
boring mormon wish - fulfillment fantasy .
the british talk of using overwhelming force but then do nothing .
wrong choice after wrong choice set her up and i just did nt care after a while .
